  <h2 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>This is an important book. It deals with a
burning question, and in a way which will
command public attention and public confidence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author is thoroughly equipped for his task.
Birth, residence, and travel in Turkey have made
him personally acquainted with the situation which
he discusses, and the independence of his position
enables him to write without restraint and without
prejudice. After nearly four years of service as a
missionary of the American Board in Van, the centre
of Armenia, during which no criticism of his course
was ever made either by the Board or by the Turkish
Government, he was recently ordered by his
physician to return to America. Having resigned
his connection with the American Board, he writes
as the representative of no society, religious or political,
and is connected with none. In issuing this
book he is simply discharging what to him is a
personal and unavoidable obligation; and as he
frankly avows its authorship, it will be impossible
for the Turkish Government to hold any one else
responsible for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author shows that the case of the subject
races in the Ottoman Empire is desperate, that there
is no hope of reform from within, and that relief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>must therefore come through the interference of the
powers of Europe. Their action depends largely on
the support of the public. “<em>Public opinion</em>,” therefore,
“<em>must be brought to bear upon this case</em>,” as Mr.
Gladstone said in the House of Commons six years
ago. Since then there has been added a new chapter
of horrors, and the demand for decisive action in
the name of our common humanity has become
more urgent. The facts furnished by this book
ought to arouse such public opinion as will justify
and compel prompt and efficient action on the part
of the Powers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The United States need not depart from its long-established
foreign policy, but is bound to protect
its own honor and the lives and property of its
citizens.</p>

  <h2 id='Preface' class='c009'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The writer has, from his birth, been a student
of the Eastern Question, but makes no claim
to having mastered it. What he has learned
of the phases of that question here treated has been
by absorption, observation, travel, residence, and
investigation, in the land itself, and by study and
reading in regard to it. The very short time allowed
in the preparation of this humble contribution to the
subject has necessitated a hasty and partial treatment
at the expense of literary form. Some of the
material of the second and third chapters and most
of the illustrations in this book are reproduced from
an article by the author in the American <cite>Review of
Reviews</cite> for January, 1895, by the kind permission of
the editor, Dr. Albert Shaw. No pains have been
spared to insure accuracy. References to authorities
have been given as far as possible, but in regard
to much information from most reliable sources
names must be withheld. It is a very significant
feature of the situation in Turkey, that people who
are thousands of miles away from her, and who may
never set foot there again, do not dare to publicly
state the facts, lest vengeance may be taken on
their families and friends, still within reach of Turkish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>violence and intrigue. If His Imperial Majesty,
the Sultan, but knew the real facts of the atrocious
massacre of last year, and realized the disgrace attaching
to the Turkish name on account of the unspeakably
brutal deeds of his Turkish and Kurdish soldiers,
officers included, we cannot but hope that some
punishment would be visited upon them, experience
to the contrary. He certainly should welcome the
revelations of this book, and do all in his power to
protect any who may aid him in bringing the facts
to light and securing a better state of affairs. God
help him, and save all his subjects, Turk, Arab, and
Kurd, Christian, Jew, and Pagan, from the curse of a
system of government not only “sick,” but dead and
rotting!</p>

<p class='c011'>I preach no crusade; none is needed. But it is
high time for the conscience of Europe and America
to assert itself—not simply the “non-Conformist
conscience,” but the Established, the Orthodox, the
Catholic, the Agnostic, and the Infidel conscience,
in fact the human conscience—against this crime
upon humanity. If this conscience is once aroused,
I care not what parties are in power, or how the
game stands on the diplomatic chessboard, the
Eastern Question will be settled, instead of forever
threatening the peace of Europe, and one more blot
will be wiped out from the annals of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>I use the title <span class='sc'>The Crisis in Turkey</span> because
there <em>is</em> a crisis in the history of one of her most
important races; there <em>ought</em> to be one throughout
Turkey; and there <em>may</em> be one in Europe if selfishness,
jealousy, and duplicity are forever to stifle all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>considerations of humanity, national honor, and—I
blush to add it—of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to protect “British interests,” for twoscore
years, not to say longer, has “Christian”
England stood guard at the Sublime Porte, warning
all intruders away. With her hand on the door
of the Turk’s disorderly house, she has complacently
informed the world that she in particular—as
well as the other Powers—has secured promises,
and even guaranties, that all would go well.
But all the while, Her Majesty’s Ministers, of whatever
party, have heard the bitter and despairing
cry of the poor wretches within. These Ministers
have, since 1881, with rare exceptions, carefully
suppressed in their archives the consular reports
which have officially kept them informed of the real
state of affairs.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> And all the while, England’s share
of the profits of this partnership with the unspeakable
Turk has been steadily dropping into her overflowing
coffers. Was Cyprus nothing? Is the interest
on Turkish bonds nothing? Of course the creditor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>must have his due, even though it is extracted in
blood-drops by a pressure that England and the
other Powers help to maintain.</p>

<p class='c011'>A famous London divine recently preached a sermon
in connection with the Armenian Massacre, using
as a text Ezra ix., 3: “And when I heard this thing, I
rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the
hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down
astonied.” May I suggest that it is high time to
rouse oneself from mere astonishment, as did the
Hebrew prophet? If the eloquent preacher is at a
loss for an appropriate text for another sermon to an
English audience, he can find it in the sixth verse of
the same chapter: “O my God, I am ashamed and
blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our
iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass
is grown up unto the heavens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The very well informed correspondent of <cite>The
Speaker</cite> wrote from Constantinople two months ago:
“I fear there can be no doubt about the essential
facts. We have already the official reports of the
consuls at Van, Erzroom, Sivas, and Diarbekir,
which have not yet been published, but which, we
know, confirm the most horrible statements made in
the newspapers. We have the reports of the Armenian
refugees who were eye-witnesses. We have
the reports sent to the Armenian Patriarchate here,
and the reports of Catholic and Protestant missionaries
in the vicinity of Sasun. Beyond this, and most
horrible of all, we have the testimony of the Turkish
soldiers who took part in the massacres. These soldiers&nbsp;... have talked with the greatest freedom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>in public places, and to all who would listen, boasting
of their deeds. We have full reports from all these
places of the statements made by hundreds of these
soldiers, and they agree in all essential points.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The author does not ignore the repeated and
earnest efforts that have been made for years, by
such individual Englishmen as the Hon. James
Bryce, to call attention to the condition of Armenia.
Their protests have kept alive Armenian hope that
England at least would not entirely repudiate her
obligations. But the futility of these same protests
has also given assurance to the Sublime Porte in
carrying out its policy of repression and extermination
in Armenia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course neither the party in power, nor its successors,
will proceed energetically unless assured of
the support of the people whom they represent. As
soon as there is sufficient pressure from behind something
more will be done than to dally with Turkish
Commissions of Inquiry, sent under circumstances
which make a true and full report simply a physical
and moral impossibility.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The Turk is on trial and
should be allowed to plead “Not Guilty.” But it is
not customary, in courts where justice is the object,
to allow the criminal at the bar the privilege of acting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>also as the prosecuting attorney, and of summoning
and examining the witnesses. As is well known,
the most stringent measures have been taken by the
Sublime Porte to prevent any representative of the
press from watching the proceedings of the Commission
of Inquiry at Moosh, or from making any
independent investigation on the ground. Such precautions
are hardly necessary, for all evidence of the
massacre was concealed by torch and spade six
months ago. If the executioners themselves overlooked
any of their victims, the jackals, dogs, and
vultures have surely found them by this time.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are fifty native-born American citizens, not
counting their children, who are now buried in
Eastern Turkey. The fanatical outbreak which has
slain thousands in their midst may yet involve them.
The President of the United States long ago ordered
a U. S. Consul to make a report as to the facts, simply
for his own government, which has no official knowledge
of what has or is taking place in that isolated
region. The Sultan stamped his foot, and Consul
Jewett was told to put his instructions in his pocket,
where they still remain.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>As for France, who tattoos her fair figure with
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité</span></i>” wherever there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>space to write the words, she evidently confines her
motto to herself. It is reported that at the close of
the Berlin Treaty of 1878, Prince Bismarck expressed
his sentiments by saying that he “would not give
one Pomeranian grenadier for the Balkan Peninsula.”
If so, probably he would sacrifice even less now for
Armenia. Have the German people nothing to say?</p>

<p class='c011'>Holy Russia feels so sure of the Armenian apple,
which seems bound to fall into her lap, that she
doesn’t even care to shake the branch, unmindful of
the fact that the apple is tenacious of its hold, and is
being pecked to pieces and rotting on the stem.
Austria would not refuse the task of instituting
reforms as far south as Salonica. Poor Italy is willing
to be useful, and Greece does not care to be left
out. They all want their share. Nobody expects
or is trying to secure reforms from within, though
promises to that effect may still be demanded, and
will always be ready on demand.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for official Turkey, she has long seen the sword
of Damocles over her head, and will bow to the stroke
of Fate whenever it falls. If it only comes hard
enough, and is aimed true to the mark, she will even
get out of the way. <em>Not a drop of blood need be shed.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>What is the real difficulty in Turkey? Is it a conflict
of race or religion? <em>Primarily</em> it is neither,
though both these elements complicate the case. <em>In
one word it is misgovernment.</em> Do not be deceived
by this rather mild word, and dismiss the subject
with the reflection that “there is misgovernment
everywhere.” Misgovernment as it exists in Turkey
is an organization that breeds death and corruption.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>It is a disease, of which the germs penetrate the
whole system of the body politic. It is a disease,
hereditary, chronic, and fastened upon the very
vitals of its victim. No creed is exempt, every race
is attacked by it. The more apparent result is outward
impoverishment and material prostration. The
more dangerous and deplorable symptom is the moral
deterioration of all the races affected.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am no eulogist of the mass of Armenians in their
present condition. But I know their grand possibilities
as a race, physically, intellectually, and
morally. The depths to which an individual or a
race can fall indicate the height which might have
been attained. The only wonder is that a people of
so great ability, energy, and spirit have so long submitted.
But when one sees, as I have been compelled
to, during years of residence both in Constantinople
and the interior, how the fetters have been forged
on every limb, and how the movement of a finger
even brings down immediate and terrible vengeance,
the wonder arises why these wretches are so foolhardy
as to undertake revolution. The fact is they
are not engaged in any such enterprise. Individual
agitators there are, but even their object is only to
force the civilized world to give attention to the despairing
cry of their race, which even God does not
seem, to them, to hear.</p>

<p class='c011'>The case of the Armenians demands immediate
and thorough attention. But the Armenian question
should not be allowed to fill the whole horizon in the
Levant. Just now the blaze comes from their house,
but no one can tell when it may result in a general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>conflagration. All the other Christian races and the
Mohammedan races, too, are equally concerned.
Europe itself is endangered, as her statesmen well
know, and safety depends only on their prompt and
united action.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have seen the crushing and—what is worse—demoralizing
conditions from which the Armenian
and all other races in Turkey suffer under Moslem
misrule. I know how rapidly these fine races would
advance along every line, were these conditions
changed. It is my firm belief that such changes
may now be secured, if the interest already aroused
throughout the civilized world be expressed in intelligent
and determined action. In the hope of such
action I send forth this little book. If action is <em>not</em>
taken, the effect of this book, as of all agitation in
behalf of the victims of Turkey, will be to draw the
fetters deeper. What result may follow to my many
friends and former associates on the ground, with
whom it is very difficult to communicate, I do not
know. But I know them, and do not believe that
there is one among their number who, to shield himself
from danger, would stay my pen.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>CERTIFIED EVIDENCE OF THE MASSACRE IN SASSOUN.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>We, the undersigned, by examination and comparison,
have satisfied ourselves that the
following statements are verbatim reports,
written under the dates which they bear, by American
citizens who have spent from six to thirty years in
Eastern Turkey. We have examined also the fact
that they are written from six different cities from
one hundred to two hundred miles apart, but forming
a circle about the centre in which the massacres
occurred. For the personal safety of the writers the
names of the places cannot now be made public.
They are independent reports from a country where
refugees and returned soldiers of the Sultan speak of
what they know. We have the utmost confidence
in these statements and regard them worthy the
belief of all men.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the name of a suffering humanity we urge the
careful perusal of these statements, and recommend
that all readers take measures to make the indignation
of an outraged Christian world effectually
felt. We deprecate revolution among these helpless
Turkish subjects, but bespeak cordial co-operation
in bringing to bear upon Turkey the force of the
righteous condemnation of our seventy millions of
people.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>EXPLANATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>These letters are written by men who can have
no possible motive for misrepresenting the
facts in the case, while, on the other hand,
each writer subjected himself to personal danger by
putting such statements upon paper and sending
them through the mails. Several of the documents
have gotten through Turkey by circuitous routes, in
some instances having been sent by special messenger
to Persia, and so on to this country. Others were
never risked in the Turkish mails, but have come
through the British post-office at Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be borne in mind that no writer was an
eye-witness of the actual massacre; nor could he
have been, inasmuch as the whole region was surrounded
by a military cordon during the massacre
and for months after. The letters are largely based
on the testimony of refugees from that region, or of
Kurds and soldiers who participated in the butchery,
and who had no hesitation in speaking about the
affair in public or private until long after, when the
prospect of a European investigation sealed their
lips. Much of the evidence is, therefore, essentially
first hand, having been obtained from eye-witnesses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>by parties in the vicinity at the time, who are impartial,
thoroughly experienced in sifting Oriental
testimony, familiar with the Turkish and Armenian
languages, and of the highest veracity. No one letter
would have much force if taken alone, for it might
be a large report of a small matter; but these sixteen
letters are written independently of one another, at
different times, and from seven different cities widely
apart, five of them forming a circle around the scene
of destruction. The evidence is cumulative and
overwhelming.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is absolute unanimity to this extent: that
a gigantic and indescribably horrible massacre of
Armenian men, women, and children did actually
take place in the Sassoun and neighboring regions
about Sept. 1, 1894, and that, too, at the hands of
Kurdish troops armed by the Sultan of Turkey, as
well as of regular soldiers sent under orders from the
same source. What those orders were will probably
never transpire. That they were executed under the
personal direction of high Turkish military officers is
clear. There can also be no doubt—for the official
notice from the palace was printed in the Constantinople
papers in November last—that Zekki Pasha,
Commander of the Fourth Army Corps, who led the
regular troops in the work of extermination, has
since been specially honored by a decoration from
the Sultan, who was also pleased to send silk banners
to the four leading Kurdish chiefs, by a special messenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latest, most accurate, and comprehensive document
in this correspondence is No. 6, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>based on evidence obtained with special care at the
nearest attainable point to the scene, and was prepared
by parties in intimate relations with the
European official who made the first investigation
on the ground last October, but whose report has
not yet been made public.</p>

<p class='c011'>The letters are arranged in chronological order.
In view of the fact that the names of the cities from
which the various documents are dated must be
withheld at present, these places are designated by
letters of the alphabet. The separate extracts are
also numbered to facilitate reference. In order that
there may be no confusion, all explanatory comments
of the author are enclosed in brackets.</p>

<p class='c011'>It does seem in this region as if the government
were bent on reducing all those who survive the
process to a grovelling poverty, when they can think
of nothing more than getting their daily bread.
There is good reason for thinking that unless so-called
Christian nations extend a helping hand, they
[the Armenians] will become wellnigh extinct. Of
course I do not sympathize in any way with the extremists
in other lands who are stirring things up
here. Nor do I agree with those papers that decry
this movement as very foolish because there is no
hope for success. If I rightly interpret the movement
in this region, the thought is not revolution at
all, but a desperate effort to call the attention of
Europe to the wrongs they are suffering and will
ever continue to suffer under this government. They
feel that they will never succeed in attracting that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>attention unless they show that they are desperate
enough to sacrifice their lives. <em>And there is no computing
the lives that are going, not in open massacre as
in Bulgaria—the government knows better than that,—but
in secret, silent, secluded ways.</em> The sooner it is
known, the better. There never will be peaceful,
prosperous conditions here until others take hold
with a strong hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Troops have been massed in the region of the
large plain near us. Sickness broke out among them,
which took off two or three victims every few days.
It was a good excuse for establishing the quarantine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>around, with its income from bribes, charges, and
the inevitable rise in the price of the already dear
grain. I suspect that one reason for placing quarantine
was to hinder the information as to what all
those troops were about in that region. There
seems little doubt that there has been repeated in
the region back of Moosh what took place in 1876
in Bulgaria. The sickening details are beginning to
come in. As in that case, it has been the innocent
who have been the greatest sufferers. Forty-eight
villages are said to have been wholly blotted out.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the time goes on the extent of the slaughter
seems to be confirmed as greater than was first supposed.
Six thousand is a low figure—it is probably
nearer ten. Mr. Hallward, the new [English] Consul
at Van, has gone directly there, and it is said that
the other consuls from Erzroom have also been sent
to investigate. The government tried to get the
people here to sign an address to the Sovereign, expressing
satisfaction with his rule, disclaiming sympathy
with the Armenians who have “stirred matters
up,” stating that the thousands slain in Talvoreeg
met their just deserts, and that the four outsiders
captured should be summarily punished, expressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>regret that it has been thought best to send consuls
to investigate, and stating that there was no need for
their coming. From this document we at least get
some facts that before were suppositions. It consisted
of about two thousand words, and it was expected
that it would be sent by telegraph with at
least a thousand signatures. The Armenians here
have not yet signed it, though in four districts similar
papers have been secured properly sealed. <em>The
effect of such papers on foreigners will be much modified
when they know the means used to procure them.</em>
Sword, famine, pestilence, all at once—pity this
poor country!</p>

<p class='c011'>We have word from Bitlis that the destruction of
life in Sassoun, south of Moosh, was even greater
than was supposed. The brief note which has
reached us says: “Twenty-seven villages annihilated
in Sassoun. Six thousand men, women, and
children massacred by troops and Kourds. This
awful story is just beginning to be known here,
though the massacre took place early in September.
The Turks have used infinite pains to prevent news
leaking out, even going to the length of sending
back from Trebizond many hundreds from the Moosh
region who had come this way on business.” This
massacre was ordered from Constantinople in the
sense that some Kourds having robbed Armenian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>villages of flocks, the Armenians pursued and tried
to recover their property, and a fight ensued in
which a dozen Kourds were killed. The slain were
“semi-official robbers,” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, enrolled as troops and
armed as such, but not under control. The authorities
then telegraphed to Constantinople that Armenians
had “killed some of the Sultan’s troops.” The
Sultan at once ordered infantry and cavalry to put
down the Armenian rebellion, and they did it; only,
not finding any rebellion, they cleared the country
so that none should occur in the future.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Last year the Talvoreeg Armenians successfully
resisted the attacks of the neighboring Kourds. The
country became very unsettled. This year the government
interfered and sent detachments of regular
soldiers to put down the Armenians. These were
assisted by the Kourdish <em>Hamediéhs</em> [organized
troops]. The Armenians were attacked in their
mountain fastnesses and were finally reduced by the
failure of supplies, both of food and ammunition.
About a score of villages were wiped out of existence—people
slaughtered and houses burned.</p>

<p class='c011'>A number of able-bodied young Armenians were
captured, bound, covered with brushwood and
burned alive. A number of Armenians, variously
estimated, but less than a hundred, surrendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>themselves and pled for mercy. Many of them were
shot down on the spot and the remainder were dispatched
with sword and bayonet.</p>

<p class='c011'>A lot of women, variously estimated from 60 to
160 in number, were shut up in a church, and the
soldiers were “let loose” among them. Many of
them were outraged to death and the remainder dispatched
with sword and bayonet. A lot of young
women were collected as spoils of war. Two stories
are told. 1. That they were carried off to the harems
of their Moslem captors. 2. That they were offered
Islam and the harems of their Moslem captors,—refusing,
they were slaughtered. Children were placed
in a row, one behind another, and a bullet fired down
the line, apparently to see how many could be dispatched
with one bullet. Infants and small children
were piled one on the other and their heads struck
off. Houses were surrounded by soldiers, set on fire,
and the inmates forced back into the flames at the
point of the bayonet as they tried to escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this is enough of the carnage of death. Estimates
vary from 3000 to 8000 for the number of
persons massacred. These are sober estimates. Wild
estimates place the number as high as 20,000 to
25,000.</p>

<p class='c011'>This all took place during the latter part of August
and [early part of] September. The arrival of the
commander-in-chief of the Fourth Army Corps put a
stop to the carnage. It is to be noted that the
massacres were perpetrated by regular soldiers, for
the most part under command of officers of high
rank. This gives this affair a most serious aspect.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>A Christian does not enjoy the respect accorded
to street dogs. If this massacre passes without notice
it will simply become the declaration of the doom of
the Christians. There will be no security for the life,
property, or honor of a Christian. A week ago last
Tuesday evening at sundown a Turk kidnapped the
wife of a wealthy Armenian merchant of the town
of Khanoos Pert. Next morning her cries were overheard
by searchers and she was rescued from a
Turkish house. No redress is possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wild rumors have been abroad for a long time, but
trustworthy information came to hand slowly. Everything
has been done to hush it all up. Some of the
minor details of the stories I have told above may not
be exact, but I feel quite certain they are in the main.
However, that a cruelly barbarous and extensive
massacre of Christians by regular soldiers assisted by
Kourdish <em>Hamediéhs</em>, under command of officers of
rank and responsibility, has occurred cannot be
denied.</p>

<p class='c020'>[This is the most complete account, compiled on

any one of whom would be of sufficient guaranty
to give great weight. One of the party, who is
largely responsible for the data given, is a man of

collected with the greatest difficulty and under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>constant espionage of Turkish officials. Armenian
Christians who were known to appear at the place
where the writer was staying, were arrested and some
are yet in prison if they have not met a worse fate
already. The documents were sent by secret, special
carriers into Persia and came by Persian post to the
United States. They left Turkey about the last of
November, 1894. This document alone is sufficient
to stir the indignation of a Christian world.]</p>

<p class='c011'>There is uneasiness in Bitlis as to the safety of that
city. Scrutiny of the mails by the Turkish authorities
continues, and some letters addressed to residents
and officials in the United States are failing
to arrive.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Hamediéh</em> soldiers, who are Kourds, and who
have been enrolled during the past three years, are
uniformed to some extent, but left in their homes.
They are committing all kinds of depredations. The
government continues to exact taxes in the plundered
districts, sends <em>zaptiehs</em>, or Turkish soldiers,
to abide in the villages, and eat the people out of
provisions until in some way they manage to secure
the money. In the Bashkalla region many of the
men find, on returning, that the government has
taken possession of their property and refuses to
restore it or allow them to remain in their old homes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The authorities have taken and are taking every
precaution to prevent accounts of the famous massacre
of Moosh from reaching the outside world.
The English consul, Mr. Hallward, went on a tour in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the region affected. He was subjected to constant
annoying espionage, and was absolutely unable to
penetrate into the devastated region.</p>

<p class='c011'>To what extent Armenian agitation has provoked
the terrible massacre it is difficult to determine. For
a year or more there seems to have been an Armenian
from Constantinople staying in the region as an
agitator. For a long time he skilfully evaded his
pursuers, but was at last caught and taken to Bitlis.
He demanded to be taken to Constantinople and to
the Sultan, and, it is said, he is now living at the
capital, receiving a large salary from the government.
Evidently he has turned state’s evidence.</p>

<h5 class='c017'>FACTS REGARDING A MASSACRE AT SASSOUN, NEAR MOOSH, TURKEY.</h5>

<p class='c020'>Late in May, 1893, an outside agitator named
Damatian was captured near Moosh. The government
had suspected that the Talvoreeg villages
were harboring such agitators, and had
sent orders to certain Kourdish chiefs to attack the
district, assuming the responsibility for all they
should kill, and promising the Kourds all the spoil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not long after Damatian had been brought to
Bitlis, the first week in June, the Bakranlee Kourds
began to gather below Talvoreeg. As the villagers
saw the Kourds gathering day by day, to the number
of several thousands, they suspected their designs,
and began to make preparations. On the
eighth day the battle was joined. The stronger
position of the villagers enabled them to do considerable
execution with little loss to themselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The issue of the contest at sunset was some one
hundred Kourds slain, and but six of the villagers,
one of whom was a woman who was trying to rescue
a mule from the Kourds. The villagers had succeeded
in breaking down a bridge across the deep
gorge of a river before a detachment of Kourds from
another direction could join in the attack against
them. The Kourds thus felt themselves worsted,
and could not be induced to make another attack
that summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this juncture the Governor-general set out
with troops and two field-pieces for Moosh, and infested
the region near Talvoreeg, but either he considered
his forces insufficient, or he had orders to
keep quiet, for he made no attack, but merely had
the troops keep siege. Before leaving, he succeeded,
by giving hostages, in having an interview with some
of the chief men in Talvoreeg, and asked them why
they did not submit to the government, and pay
taxes. They replied that they were not disloyal to
the government, but that they could not pay taxes
twice, to the Kourds and to the government. If
the government would protect them, they would
pay to it. Nothing came of the parley, and the
siege was continued till snow fell. During the winter,
while blackmail was rife in the vilayet, several
rich men of Talvoreeg were invited to visit the
Governor-General, but did not see best to accept.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early spring the Kourds of several tribes
were ordered to attack the villages of Sassoun, while
troops were sent on from Moosh and Bitlis, the latter
taking along ammunition and stores, and ten muleloads of kerosene (eighty cans). The whole district
was pretty well besieged by Kourds and troops.
The villages thus besieged would occasionally make
sorties to secure food.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The Kourds on one occasion stole several oxen,
and their owners tracked their property to the
Kourdish tents, and found that one ox had been
butchered. They asked for the others, and were
refused, whereupon the villagers left, and later returned
with some companions. A scrimmage ensued,
in which two or three were killed on either side.
The Kourds at once took their dead to the government
at Moosh, and reported that the region was
filled with Armenian and foreign soldiers. The
government at once sent in all directions for soldiers,
gathering in all from eight to ten <em>taboors</em>
(regiments). Kourds congregated to the number of
about twenty thousand, while some five hundred
<em>Hamediéh</em> horsemen were brought to Moosh.</p>

<h5 class='c017'>METHODS OF PROCEDURE AND INCIDENTS OF THE MASSACRE.</h5>

<p class='c020'>At first the Kourds were set on, and the troops
kept out of sight. The villagers, put to the
fight, and thinking they had only the Kourds to
do with, repulsed them on several occasions. The
Kourds were unwilling to do more unless the troops
assisted. Some of the troops assumed Kourdish
dress, and helped them in the fight with more success.
Small companies of troops entered several
villages, saying they had come to protect them as
loyal subjects, and were quartered among the houses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>In the night they arose and slew the sleeping villagers,
man, woman, and child.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time those in other villages were beginning
to feel that extermination was the object of the
government, and desperately determined to sell
their lives as dearly as possible. And then began a
campaign of butchery that lasted some twenty-three
days, or, roughly, from the middle of August to the
middle of September. The <em>Ferik</em> Pasha [Marshal
Zekki Pasha], who came post-haste from Erzingan,
read the Sultan’s firman for extermination, and
then, hanging the document on his breast, exhorted
the soldiers not to be found wanting in their duty.
<em>On the last day of August, the anniversary of the
Sultan’s accession, the soldiers were especially urged to
distinguish themselves, and they made it the day of the
greatest slaughter.</em> Another marked day occurred a
few days earlier, being marked by the occurrence of
a wonderful meteor.</p>

<p class='c011'>No distinctions were made between persons or
villages, as to whether they were loyal and had paid
their taxes or not. The orders were to make a clean
sweep. A priest and some leading men from one
village went out to meet an officer, taking in their
hands their tax receipts, declaring their loyalty, and
begging for mercy; but the village was surrounded,
and all human beings put to the bayonet. A large
and strong man, the chief of one village, was captured
by the Kourds, who tied him, threw him on
the ground, and, squatting around him, stabbed him
to pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Galogozan many young men were tied hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and foot, laid in a row, covered with brushwood and
burned alive. Others were seized and hacked to
death piecemeal. At another village a priest and
several leading men were captured, and promised
release if they would tell where others had fled, but,
after telling, all but the priest were killed. A chain
was put around the priest’s neck, and pulled from
opposite sides till he was several times choked and
revived, after which several bayonets were planted
upright, and he raised in the air and let fall upon them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men of one village, when fleeing, took the
women and children, some five hundred in number,
and placed them in a sort of grotto in a ravine.
After several days the soldiers found them, and
butchered those who had not died of hunger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sixty young women and girls were selected from
one village and placed in a church, when the soldiers
were ordered to do with them as they liked, after
which they were butchered.</p>

<p class='c011'>In another village fifty choice women were set
aside and urged to change their faith and become
<em>hanums</em> in Turkish harems, but they indignantly
refused to deny Christ, preferring the fate of their
fathers and husbands. People were crowded into
houses which were then set on fire. In one instance
a little boy ran out of the flames, but was caught on
a bayonet and thrown back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Children were frequently held up by the hair and
cut in two, or had their jaws torn apart. Women
with child were ripped open; older children were
pulled apart by their legs. A handsome, newly
wedded couple fled to a hilltop; soldiers followed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and told them they were pretty and would be spared
if they would accept Islam, but the thought of the
horrible death they knew would follow did not prevent
them from confessing Christ.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last stand took place on Mount Andoke
[south of Moosh], where some thousand persons had
sought refuge. The Kourds were sent in relays to
attack them, but for ten or fifteen days were unable
to get at them. The soldiers also directed the fire
of their mountain guns on them, doing some execution.
Finally, after the besieged had been without
food for several days, and their ammunition was exhausted,
the troops succeeded in reaching the summit
without any loss, and let scarcely a man escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now all turned their attention to those who had
been driven into the Talvoreeg district. Three or
four thousand of the besieged were left in this small
plain. When they saw themselves thickly surrounded
on all sides by Turks and Kourds, they
raised their hands to heaven with an agonizing moan
for deliverance. They were thinned out by rifle
shots, and the remainder were slaughtered with
bayonets and swords, till a veritable river of blood
flowed from the heaps of the slain.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so ended the massacre, for the timely arrival
of the Mushire [Commander-in-chief of the Fourth
Army Corps at Erzingan] saved a few prisoners
alive, and prevented the extermination of four more
villages that were on the list to be destroyed, among
which was the Protestant village of Havodorick.
This was the formidable army the government had
massed so many troops and Kourds to vanquish.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>So far as is known, not more than ten or fifteen
outsiders were among them, and all told it is not
likely they had more than one hundred breechloading
rifles.</p>

<h5 class='c017'>THE NUMBER OF ARMENIANS SLAIN.</h5>

<p class='c020'>Even if one were able to visit the district, it would
be impossible to get more than an approximate estimate
of the number of victims, for many were thrown
into trenches, which the rain had washed out, and
were covered with earth. Where no such trenches
existed the bodies were piled up with alternate layers
of wood, saturated with kerosene, and set on fire.
But it seems certain that the villages of the whole
district were wiped out. A Kourdish chief coming
late with his men, and finding that there was nothing
left for him to do, went off on his own hook and
got all the plunder he could from the village of
Maineeg, near Havodorick.</p>

<p class='c011'>A soldier while in quarantine said he had killed
five persons, and he had killed less than anybody
else. Another confided to one that he had killed a
hundred. A soldier got angry while trading with an
Armenian the other day in the Bitlis market, and
shouted out that they had slain a thousand thousand,
and would turn to those in the city next.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seems safe to say that forty villages were totally
destroyed, and it is probable that sixteen thousand
at least were killed. <em>The lowest estimate is ten thousand</em>,
and many put it much higher. This is allowing
for more fugitives than it seems possible can
have escaped.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>To cap the climax, the Governor-General, through
imprisonment and intimidation of various kinds, has

<p class='c011'>The massacre which took place a few weeks ago—I
do not know the exact date—occurred in the district
of Talvoreeg which lies between Moosh and Diarbekir.
It is an Armenian district, comprising thirty or
forty villages, surrounded by Kourds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Last year some of the Armenians there armed
themselves and resisted the Kourds, who are constantly
making raids on their villages and carrying
off their property. The Governor sent some soldiers,
who killed a few Armenians and received a medal
from the government for having wiped out a great
rebellion. This year there are said to have been ten
or fifteen revolutionists among these Armenians. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Kourdish chief in order to get out of some difficulties
that he had gotten into with the government
set the ball rolling by carrying off some cattle belonging
to certain of the Armenians. The Armenians
endeavored to recover the cattle, and a fight
followed, in which two Kourds were killed and three
were wounded. The Kourds immediately carried
their dead to Moosh, laid them down at the government
house, reporting that Armenian soldiers were
overrunning the land, killing and plundering them.</p>

<p class='c011'>This furnished the government with the desired
excuse for collecting soldiers from far and near.
The general is said to have worn on his breast an
order from Constantinople, which he read to the soldiers,
commanding them to cut down the Armenians
root and branch, and adjuring them if they loved
their Sultan and their government they would do
so. A terrible massacre followed. Between five and
ten thousand Christians are said to have been
butchered in a most terrible manner. Some soldiers
say a hundred fell to each one of them to dispose
of; others wept because the Kourds did more execution
than they.</p>

<p class='c011'>No respect was shown to age or sex. Men, women,
and infants were treated alike, except that the women
were subjected to greater outrage before they were
slaughtered. The women were not even granted the
privilege of a life of slavery. For example, in one
place three or four hundred women, after being
forced to serve the vile purposes of a merciless soldiery,
were taken to a valley near by and hacked to
pieces with sword and bayonet. In another place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>about two hundred women, weeping and wailing,
knelt before the commander and begged for mercy,
but the blood-thirsty wretch, after ordering their
violation directed the soldiers to dispatch them in a
similar manner. In another place a large company,
headed by the priest, fell down before the officers
saying they had nothing to do with the culprits, and
pleading for compassion, but all to no purpose—all
were killed. Some sixty young brides and more attractive
girls were crowded into a little church in
another village, where, after being violated, they
were slaughtered, and a stream of human blood
flowed from the church door. To some of the more
attractive women in one place the proposition was
made that they might be spared if they denied their
faith. “Why should we deny Christ,” they said,
and pointing to the dead bodies of their husbands
and brothers before them, they nobly answered, “We
are no better than they; kill us too,”—and they died.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the above-mentioned events the Governor
attempted to persuade and compel the Armenians to
sign a paper thanking the Sultan and himself that
justice had been done to the rebels!</p>

<p class='c011'>The Armenians, oppressed by Kourds and Turks,
said, “We can’t pay taxes to both Kourds and the
government.” Plundered and oppressed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Kourds, they resisted them; there were some killed.
Then false reports were sent to Constantinople that
the Armenians were in arms, in rebellion. Orders
were sent to the Mushire [Commander-in-chief] at
Erzingan to exterminate them root and branch. The
orders read before the army collected in haste from
all the chief cities of Eastern Turkey was: “Whoever
spares man, woman, or child is disloyal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The region was surrounded by soldiers of the army
and twenty thousand Kourds also are said to have
been massed there. Then they advanced upon the
centre, driving in the people like a flock of sheep, and
continued thus to advance for days. No quarter was
given, no mercy shown. Men, women, and children
shot down or butchered like sheep. Probably when
they were set upon in this way some tried to save
their lives and resisted in self-defense. Many who
could fled in all directions, but the majority were
slain. The most probable estimate is fifteen thousand
killed, thirty-five villages plundered, razed, burnt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Women were outraged and then butchered; a
priest taken to the roof of his church and hacked to
pieces; young men piled in with wood saturated
with kerosene and set on fire; a large number of
women and girls collected in church, kept for days,
violated by the brutal soldiers, and then murdered.
It is said the number was so large that the blood
flowed out of the church door. Three soldiers contended
over a beautiful girl. They wanted to preserve
her, but she too was killed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every effort is being made and will be made to
falsify (excuse the blots—emblematic of the horrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>story) the facts and pull the wool over the eyes of
European governments. But the bloody tale will
finally be known, the most horrible, it seems to me,
that the nineteenth century has known. As a confirmation
of the report, the other day several hundred
soldiers were returning from the seat of war,
and at a village near us one was heard to say that
he alone with his own hand had killed thirty pregnant
women. Some who seem to have some shame for
their atrocious deeds say: “What could we do, we
were under orders?”</p>

<p class='c011'>You may believe most all that the papers say about
the mountains west of Moosh. I wrote you giving
you a few more authenticated details. I hope that
letter reached you. I give the outline here again. In
August the Armenians were declared in rebellion.
The regular soldiers and <em>Hamediéhs</em> were ordered to
the spot. Orders were issued from Constantinople
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to put down the rebellion. Both regulars and
<em>Hamediéhs</em> were used. The massacre began after
the middle of August—about the 18th—and continued
to about the 10th of September. The safe
estimates put the number of victims at about four
thousand, not less than three thousand five hundred,
and, in all probability, more than four thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Men, women, and children were most barbarously
slaughtered—unnamable outrages were perpetrated
on all. The less horrible outrages were some of the
following: bayoneting the men, and in this wounded
condition either burying or burning them; outraging
women and then dispatching them with bayonets or
swords; ripping up pregnant women; impaling infants
and children on the bayonet, or dispatching
them with the sword; houses fired, and the inmates
driven back into the flames.</p>

<p class='c011'>The unspeakable horror of those three weeks must
have sent many a one crazy. The story is told that
one soldier found a comely infant and took compassion
on it and wished to save it. The mother was
found in a crowd of poor, wretched women, but she
was raving, calling for her children. She did not
recognize the child, and nothing was left to the soldier
but to dispatch it.</p>

In the meantime Sassoun refugees are scattered
over the country, begging. Their stories, together
with the stories of the soldiers, confirm the
most horrible of the reports of cruelty.</p>

<p class='c011'>In all this, remember that the same thing has been
going on on a lesser scale all over the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two weeks ago thirty-six men were dismissed from
B... prison after three years three months’ detention.
A little over three years ago three Armenians
were most barbarously murdered in the Narman
district, north of this city and near the Russian
boundary. Some Turks were called up for examination,
and all were dismissed. Later, three Turks were
murdered and mutilated, apparently in retaliation.
The able-bodied men—sixty-two in number—of two
villages were thrown into prison. Some of them were
condemned to death, some to life imprisonment, and
others to various terms of imprisonment. A number
of them died—fifteen, I think—in prison. Thirty-six
were released the other day, and eleven are still in
prison. They have suffered horribly during these
three years. In what condition will they find their
homes when those who are released return? It is
almost certain that none of them knew anything
about the murder or had any hand in it. It is said
that the murderer is well known, and is in Russia.

<p class='c011'>The importance of the present crisis grows upon
me. In the first place Turkey is preparing for a terrible
catastrophe by squeezing Armenians, and arming
Moslem civilians in Sivas, Aleppo, Castamouni,
and other provinces; and in the second place it is
putting on the screws tighter everywhere excepting
in the three eastern provinces where the Commission
is now commencing investigation. In Van and Bitlis
the process of arresting and intimidating witnesses
went on until the very hour of the departure of the
Commission of Investigation. Then the order went
out to stop, and those provinces are enjoying the
first semblance of quiet that they have known for
five years.</p>

<p class='c011'>This policy of continued massacre and outrage is
favored by the profound ignorance which prevails
everywhere as to the actual state of things in Turkey.
People think that the Sassoun massacre is something exceptional,
and that until that is proved there is no
evidence of a need of European interference in behalf
of Christians in Turkey. What ought to be done is
to fix on the mind of the public the fact that Turkey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>has taken up the policy of crushing the Christians all
over the Empire, and has been at it for several years,
so that even if the massacre had not taken place, the
duty of Europe to prohibit Turkey from acting the
part of Anti-Christ was still self-evident.</p>

some time, and without doubt the local authorities
have used every means to cover up their tracks and
terrorize still further those who may be probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>witnesses. Those who are encouraged to testify will
be again at the mercy of the Turks after the Commission
rises. I have not the slightest doubt that
some will be courageous enough to testify, but it
will be at great odds. Almost everything is against
the perfect success of the Commission’s work, or
rather the favorable outcome of the work of the
European delegates. It will not be right to stake
the fate of Armenia on the outcome of the work of
this Commission.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rather it should be remembered that Sassoun is
the outcome of a governmental system. There have
been hundreds of Sassouns all over the country all
through the last ten years, as you know. The laxity
of Europe has afforded opportunity for the merciless
working of this system in all its vigor. It is born of
religious and race hatred, and has in mind the crushing
of Christianity and Christians.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not the Kourdish robbers, or famine, or cholera
that have to answer for the present state of the
country. It is rather the robbery, and famine, and
worse than cholera entailed on the country by the
workings of this system. It is not alone the blood
of five thousand men, women, children, and babies,
that rises in a fearful wail to heaven, calling for
just vengeance, but also the fearful suffering, the
desolate homes, the wanton cruelty of tax collectors
and petty officials, and the violated honor of scores

He passed through three villages. They
were all in ruins, and mutilated bodies told the horrible
tale. For four or five days he was in one village.
During the day parties of the scattered
inhabitants would come in and throw themselves
upon the mercy of the officer in command. About
two hours after sundown each evening these prisoners
of that day were marched out of camp to a neighboring
valley, and the air was rent with their pitiful
cries. He saw nothing more of them. He estimates
that five hundred men disappeared in that way while
he was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between two hundred and three hundred women
and children were brought into camp. They also
disappeared, how he did not know. He was an
Armenian muleteer pressed for the transport of the
military. He was sent out of the district to Moosh.
He and his companion are the only eye-witnesses we

<p class='c011'>Up to May, 1894, when I left Van, the whole Christian
population of that region was simply paralyzed
by fear, and there was no manifestation of any revolutionary
thought or intention by the Armenians.
Certainly, if such a revolution were contemplated,
you would expect to find it in the Van and Bitlis
<em>vilayets</em> [provinces], where the provocation is the
greatest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those cordons and quarantine, together with the
extraordinary precautions, taken by the hitherto immovable
Turk, with regard to cholera that was still
far away and in an entirely different direction, were
a mystery to all, although every person knew that
the ostensible purpose was not the real one. Now
that the tidings from Moosh have come in, the mystery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of the series of cordons between here and Harpoot
is explained. There is very strong evidence
that a general massacre or a series of massacres of
Christians has been understood by the local governments
to be the order of the day. It is not likely
that a definite order to that effect has been given
out from the Capitol, but multitudes of recent events
go to show that the everlasting persecutions and
annoyances, and the methods used in past times to
grind down the Christians, have come to be regarded
as insufficient. Everywhere there is an activity, a
watchfulness, and an energy displayed by the government
in the recent efforts to encompass the
Christians and to cut off their name and existence,
that point to a newly formed plan to be put into execution
with as little waste of time as possible. Woe
to the poor remnant in this land if the European and
American governments disregard recent events in
Turkey! Christian nations in that case, even if they
do not directly participate in what will certainly follow
sooner or later, cannot be held guiltless of the
blood of their fellow-men....</p>

<p class='c011'>Another case in which I was concerned has gone
the same way. Last spring a Protestant woman in
Y. was assaulted and violated by three Turks. They
were tried in F. and found guilty; but that infamous
court in S., under the influence of the still more
infamous <em>Mutesarif</em> (Governor), having recently
reviewed the case, reversed the original judgment
and released the guilty. There is no remedy. No
appeal can be made. The only thing that can be
done is to prosecute the court in S., but that, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>present state of things, would be utterly useless.
The result will be that such crimes will become more
frequent than ever—the perpetrators feeling confident
that there is very little likelihood of punishment
being meted out to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The government pretends to look with special
suspicion on H. just now. The <em>Vali</em> (Governor-General)
claims there are secret societies here. I told
him there is nothing of the kind in H. now. The
poor people are afraid to open their mouths or to go
out of their houses. You can scarcely conceive the
change that has come over the people within the past
few months. Terror and amazement have taken
hold of them to such an extent as to become manifest
in their countenances even. All arms and
weapons are being taken from the people here these
days.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Kaimakam</em> (local Governor) and other officers
walk the streets and the K. road every night.
Attempts have been made by officers and soldiers
to draw Christians into a quarrel, but they have
hitherto failed. One night this week, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commissaire</span></i>
(Chief of Police) without any provocation fired
three times at a Christian, but the other offered no
resistance. Moslem officers are taking possession of
the property of Christians and doing just as they
please without regard to law or justice....</p>

<p class='c011'>The church and school in O. have been closed
and for two months now the people have not been
allowed to come together for worship. They are
forbidden even to have prayers offered in their
houses.</p>

  <h2 id='ii' class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT EASTERN TURKEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>In order that the ordinary reader may grasp the
situation in Armenia, information is given at
this point in regard to the country itself, its administration,
the elements that compose the population,
and their relations to one another.</p>

<p class='c011'>The massacre took place in the mountainous Sassoun
district just south of Moosh, two days’ ride
west of Bitlis, a large city where the Provincial-Governor
and a permanent military force reside. It is
near the western end of Lake Van, about eight hundred
miles east of Constantinople, two hundred and
fifty miles south of Trebizond on the Black Sea, and
only one hundred and fifty miles from the Russian
and Persian frontiers of Asiatic Turkey. These distances
do not seem great until the difficulties of
travel are considered. The roads are, in most cases,
bridle paths, impassable for vehicles, without bridges,
infested with highwaymen, and unprovided with
lodging-places. It is, therefore, necessary to go to
the expense of hiring government guards, and to
burden oneself with all articles likely to be needed
on the way—tents, food supplies, cooking utensils,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>beds, etc., which also imply cooks, baggage horses,
and grooms. Thus equipped, it is possible, after
obtaining the necessary government permits, often a
matter of vexatious delay, to move about the country.
The ordinary rate is from twenty to thirty
miles a day. With a good horse and no baggage I
have gone three hundred and fifty miles, from Harpoot
to Van, in eight days, but that was quite exceptional.
In spring, swollen streams and mud; in
summer, oppressive heat; and in winter, storms, are
serious impediments. In the neighborhood of Bitlis
the telegraph poles are sometimes buried, and horses
cannot be taken out of the stables on account of
the snow. The mails are often weeks behind, both
in arriving and departing, and even Turkish lightning
seems to be <em>yavash</em>, and crawl sluggishly along
the wires.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turkish Armenia—by the way, “Armenia” is a
name prohibited in Turkey—is a large plateau quadrangular
in shape, and sixty thousand square miles
in area, about the size of Iowa. It is bounded on
the north by the Russian frontier, a line from the
Black Sea to Mount Ararat, by Persia on the east, the
Mesopotamian plain on the south, and Asia Minor
on the west. It contains about six hundred thousand
Armenians, which is only one fourth the number
found in all Turkey. The surface is rough, consisting
of valleys and plains from four to six thousand
feet above sea-level, broken and shut in by bristling
peaks and mountain ranges, from ten to seventeen
thousand feet high, as in the case of Ararat. Ancient
Armenia greatly varied in extent at different epochs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>reaching to the Caspian at one time, and even bordering
on the Mediterranean Sea during the Crusades.
It included the Southern Caucasus, which now contains
a large, growing, prosperous, and happy Armenian
population under the Czar, whose government
allows them the free exercise of their ancestral religion,
and admits them to many high civil and military
positions. The Armenians now number about
four million, of whom two million five hundred
thousand are in Turkey, one million two hundred
and fifty thousand in Russia, one hundred and fifty
thousand in Persia and other parts of Asia, one hundred
thousand scattered through Europe, and five
thousand in the United States.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scenery, while harsh, owing to the lack of verdure,
is on a grand scale. Around the shores of the
great Van Lake are many views of entrancing beauty.
The climate is temperate and the atmosphere brilliant
and stimulating. It is a dry, treeless region,
but fertile under irrigation, and abounding in mineral
wealth, including coal. Owing to primitive methods
of agriculture, and to danger while reaping and even
planting crops, only a small part is under cultivation,
and frequent famines are the result. The mineral
resources are entirely untouched, because the Turks
lack both capital and brains to develop them, and
prevent foreigners from doing it lest this might
open the door for further European inspection and
interference with their methods of administering the
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>All local authority is practically in the hands of
the <em>Valis</em>, provincial governors, who are sent from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Constantinople to represent the sovereign, and are
accountable to him alone. The blind policy which
was inaugurated by the present Sultan of dismissing
non-Moslems from every branch of public service—post,
telegraph, custom-house, internal revenue, engineering,
and the like—has already been carried out
to a large extent all over the empire, and especially
in Armenia. The frequent changes in Turkish officials
keeps their business in a state of “confusion
worse confounded,” and incites them to improve
their chance to plunder while it lasts. Traces of the
relatively large revenue, wrung from the people, and
spent in improvements of service to them, are very
hard to find.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>THE INHABITANTS.</h3>

<p class='c020'>Probably about one half of the population of
Turkish Armenia is Mohammedan, composed of
Turks and Kurds. The former are mostly found in
and near the large cities, such as Erzingan, Baibourt,
Erzerum, and Van, and the plains along the northern
part. The Kurds live in their mountain villages
over the whole region. The term Kurdistan, which
in this region the Turkish Government is trying to
substitute for the historical one Armenia, has no
political or geographical propriety except as indicating
the much larger area over which the Kurds are
scattered. In this vague sense it applies to a stretch
of mountainous country about fifteen hundred miles
in length, starting between Erzingan and Malatiah,
and sweeping east and south over into Persia as far
as Kermanshah.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>A KURD OF THE OLD TYPE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The number of the Kurds is very uncertain. Neither
Sultan nor Shah has ever attempted a census of them;
and as they are very indifferent taxpayers, the revenue
tables—wilfully distorted for political purposes—are
quite unreliable. From the estimates of British consular
officers there appear to be about one and a half
million Turkish Kurds, of whom about 600,000 are in
the <em>vilayets</em> of Erzroom, Van, and Bitlis, and the rest
in the <em>vilayets</em> of Harpoot, Diarbekir, Mosul, and
Bagdad. This is a very liberal estimate. There are
also supposed to be about 750,000 in Persia.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Kurds, whose natural instincts lead them to a
pastoral and predatory life, are sedentary or nomad
according to local and climatic circumstances. Where
exposed to a severe mountain winter they live exclusively
in villages, and in the case of Bitlis have
even formed a large part of the city population. But
the tribes in the south, who have access to the Mesopotamian
plains, prefer a migratory life, oscillating
with the season between the lowlands and the mountains.
The sedentary greatly outnumber the nomad
Kurds, but the latter are more wealthy, independent,
and highly esteemed. There is, probably, little ethnic
distinction between the two classes.</p>

<p class='c011'>A fourteenth-century list of Kurdish tribes contains
many names identical with those of powerful families
who claim a remote ancestry. “There was, up to a
recent period, no more picturesque or interesting
scene to be witnessed in the East than the court of
one of these great Kurdish chiefs, where, like another
Saladin, [who was a Kurd himself,] the bey ruled in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>patriarchal state, surrounded by hereditary nobility,
regarded by his clansmen with reverence and affection,
and attended by a body-guard of young Kurdish
warriors, clad in chain armor, with flaunting silken
scarfs, and bearing javelin, lance, and sword as in the
time of the crusaders.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Within two days’ ride
southeast of Van, I found the ruins of four massive
Kurdish castles at Shaddakh, Norduz, Bashkalla, and
Khoshab, which must have rivalled those of the feudal
barons on the Rhine. The Armenian and Nestorian
villagers were much better off as serfs of the powerful
masters of these strongholds than as the victims
of Kurdish plunder and of Ottoman taxation and
oppression which they now are.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Kurds are naturally brave and hospitable, and,
in common with many other Asiatic races, possess
certain rude but strict feelings of honor. But since
their power has been broken by the Turks, their
castles ruined, and their chiefs exiled, these finer
qualities and more chivalrous sentiments have also
largely disappeared under the principle of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse
oblige</span></i> reversed. In most regions they have degenerated
into a wild, lawless set of brigands, proud,
treacherous, and cruel. The traditions of their former
position and power serve only to feed their
hatred of the Turks who caused their fall, and their
jealousy and contempt of the Christians who have
been for generations their serfs, whose progress and
increase they cannot tolerate.</p>

<p>RUINS OF A KURDISH CASTLE AT KHOSHAB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One who has a taste for adventure and is willing
to take his life in his hands, can find among them as
fine specimens of the human animal as are to be
found anywhere—sinewy, agile, and alert, with a
steady penetrating eye as cool, cold, and cruel as that
of a tiger. I vividly recollect having just this impression
under circumstances analogous to that of a
hunter who suddenly finds himself face to face with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>a lord of the jungle. There was no sense of fear, at
the time, but rather a keen delight and fascination in
watching the magnificent creature before me. His
thin aquiline face, his neck and hands were stained by
the weather to a brown as delicate as that of a
meerschaum pipe, and on his broad exposed breast
the thick growth of hair obliterated any impression
of nudeness. For a few moments he seemed engaged
in some sinister calculation, but at last quietly moved
away. Perhaps he wanted only a cigarette. Perhaps
he wondered if I, too, had claws. The Winchester
rifle behind his back did not escape my notice, nor
did the gun across my saddle escape his. It is hardly
necessary to remind those who may desire such experiences
as the above, that the usual retinue of cooks,
servants, and <em>zaptiehs</em> should be dispensed with in
order to secure the best opportunities for observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Kurdish costumes, always picturesque, show
much local variation in cut and color. The beys
and khans of the colder north almost invariably prefer
broadcloth, and find the finest fabrics and richest
shades—specially imported for them—none too good.
But the loose flowing garments of the Sheikhs and
wealthy Kocher nomads of the south are often very
inexpensive, and suggest Arab simplicity and dignity.
There is, no doubt, considerable Arab blood
in some of these families, who refer to the fact with
pride.</p>

<p class='c011'>The women of the Kurds, contrary to usual Mohammedan
custom, go unveiled and have large liberty,
but there is no reason to suspect their virtue.
Their prowess, also, is above reproach, and rash would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>be the man, Turk or Christian, who would venture
to invade the mountain home when left in charge of
its female defenders. On the whole, the Kurds are
a race of fine possibilities, far superior to the North
American Indian, to whom they are often ignorantly
compared. Under a just, intelligent, and firm government
much might be expected of them in time.</p>

<p class='c011'>They keep up a strict tribal relation, owing allegiance
to their Sheikhs, some of whom are still strong
and rich, and engage in bitter feuds with one
another. They could not stand a moment against
the Ottoman power if determined to crush and disarm
them. But three years ago His Majesty summoned
the chiefs to the capital, presented them with
decorations, banners, uniforms, and military titles,
and sent them back to organize their tribes into
cavalry regiments, on whom he was pleased to bestow
the name <em>Hamediéh</em>, after his own. Thus,
shrewdly appealing to their pride of race, and winking
at their subsequent acts, the Sultan obtained a
power eager in time of peace to crush Armenian
growth and spirit, and a bulwark that might check,
in his opinion, the first waves of the next dreaded
Russian invasion. In the last war the Kurdish contingent
was worse than useless as was shown by Mr.
Norman,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> of the <cite>London Times</cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Armenians, a very important element of the
population, are generally known as being bright,
practical, industrious, and moral. They are of a
very peaceable disposition, and entirely unskilled
in the use of arms, the mere possession of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>is a serious crime in the case of Christians, although
the Kurds are well equipped with modern
rifles and revolvers, and always carry them. Their
great and fundamental weakness, seen through all
their history, is a lack of coherence, arising from
their exaggerated individualism. They have the
distinction of being the first race who accepted
Christianity, King Dertad receiving baptism in 276
<span class='fss'>A. D.</span>, thirty-seven years before Constantine ventured
to issue even the Edict of Toleration. Their martyr
roll has grown with every century. The fact that
the Armenian stock exists at all to-day, is proof of
its wonderful vitality and excellent quality. For
three thousand years Armenia, on account of her
location, has been trampled into dust both by devastating
armies and by migrating hordes. She has
been the prey of Nebuchadnezzar, Xerxes, and Alexander;
of the Romans, the Parthians, and Persians;
of Byzantine, Saracen, and Crusader; of Seljouk and
Ottoman, and Russian and Kurd. Through this
awful record, the Christian church founded by
Gregory, “The Illuminator,” has been the one rallying
point and source of strength, and this explains
the tremendous power of the Cross on the hearts of
all, even of the most ignorant peasant.</p>

these Armenian, Jacobite, and Nestorian Christians
are condemned when no massacre is in hand. From

that the incidents related would apply to hundreds
of villages with simply a change of name.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>He gives the names of places and of the
parties concerned, both Kurds and Christians. We

in greater part for the above; also for
robbing of two houses in Ina D’Noony.</p>

<p class='c011'>For generations these Christians have sown the
fields of these Kurds, harvested them, done their
threshing, irrigated their fields, cut and brought in
the grass as fodder for the sheep for use during the
winter, together with much other labor, and all without
recompense, they finding themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>(These things are accompanied, of course, with
cursings and beatings.)”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A number of Christian villages lying farther back
in the mountains are even more severely oppressed.
The people are literally bought and sold as slaves.
In other districts the buying and selling of Christians
by Kurds is common.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Village of Shakh (five hours from Jezireh); like
Mansurieh deserted for months by reason of extortion
by tax collectors. Many of the people lived
during the winter in caves in the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The writer was in Nahrwan when the Kaimakam
of Jezireh came, several weeks after a murder, to
examine into it. The examination was rendered
so oppressive to the Christians that the people were
glad to declare that nothing had happened, in order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>escape any further inquisition. Even the old mother
of the murdered man was frightened until she declared
that she did not know of any such occurrence,
and had no complaints to make against anybody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kannybalaver—Kaimakamlik of Amadia. During
the years 1893–’94 this village was raided several
times by the Gugier and Sendier Kurds of the
Kaimakamlik of Jezireh. They took one hundred
head of animals, field tools, household utensils, beds,
wool and yarn, gall-nuts—all of their fall gathering,—and
dry goods which had been brought in to sell.
At their last visit everything movable was carried
off, and the people deserted the village. A leading
man of the village, Gegoo by name, was seized by
the Kurds, carried for several miles, and was then
murdered in cold blood. There were about one hundred
Kurds in the band led by Ahrno, brother of
Hassu of Ukrul and Kerruvanu. The chief men of
their village are Sherriffu and Hassu, who would be
responsible for such a raid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the city of Mosul, where there is a Vali, Christians
are robbed and killed openly. Three cases are
given. Last year a young man, of the Protestant community,
of high standing in the city as a merchant,
was standing before his door when two young Kurds
of notorious character came along, and one of them,
without the slightest provocation, at the time or
previously, from mere wantonness, stabbed him, and
would have killed him had he not been restrained.
The family of the man, though one of the most influential
families among the Christians of the city,
did not dare to make accusation against him, knowing
that the only result would be more bloodshed.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“An old missionary who has been familiar with the
region from Bohtan to Amadia for years, says these
oppressions are increasing, and unless something is
done speedily, all the Christian villages of these
various districts will soon fall into the hands of the
Kurds just as they have in Zabur.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These instances of oppression given are but a few
of the many which might be given. Indeed it is
not these greater occurrences, as the big raids and
murders, which are the most serious to the Christian.
It is the daily constant exactions and oppressions
which are crushing the life out of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A whole chapter might well be devoted to the
oppression by government officials in assessing and
collecting taxes. This evil is general, affecting all
Turkey. A brief summary of these abuses as generally
practised will be given. In view of the poverty-stricken
condition of the land, even the legitimate
taxes are an exceedingly heavy burden on Moslem
and Christian alike, but the burden is greatly increased
by the methods here classified:</p>

<h3 class='c018'>SUMMARY OF ABUSES.</h3>

<p class='c020'>“I. <em>Unjust and corrupt assessments.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>1. Villagers are compelled to give assessors presents
of money to prevent them from over estimating
the taxable persons and property.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Assessors, to secure additional bribes, signify
their willingness to make an underestimate. This,
in turn, affords opportunity for blackmail, which is
used by succeeding officials.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“II. <em>Injustice and severity in collecting.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>1. The collectors, like the assessors, have ways of
extorting presents and bribes from the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The collectors, as a rule, go to the villages on
Sunday, as on that day they find the people in the
village. They frequently interrupt the Christian
services, and show disrespect to their churches or
places of prayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. The collection of the taxes is accompanied with
unnecessary abuse and reviling, sometimes even with
wanton destruction of property.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. Disregard of impoverished condition of people.
Even after several failures of crops in succession,
when famine was so severe that the people were
many of them being fed by foreign charity, the
taxes were collected in full and with severity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their food supply, beds, household utensils, and
farming implements were seized by the collectors in
lieu of taxes. Many were compelled to borrow
money at enormous rates of interest, mortgaging
their fields and future crops. Unscrupulous officials
and other Kurds, in whose interests such opportunities
are created, thus became possessed of Christian
villages, the people of which henceforth becoming
practically slaves to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. These collectors make false returns of taxes
received. The official in the city is secured by a
bribe, and the matter is kept quiet until a succeeding
set of officials come into office. They send their
officers to the villages to present claims for back
taxes. The villagers in vain contend that they have
paid them. They have no receipts. They do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>dare to ask for them. Or the head man of the village
who keeps the account has been bribed to falsify
his accounts. These taxes are collected again, entailing
much suffering upon the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>6. The books in the government offices at the
Kaimakamlik are often incorrect through mistakes
or dishonesty, and in consequence taxes are paid on
fictitious names or on persons who have been dead
for years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“III. <em>Farming of taxes.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>Taxes are often farmed out to the highest bidder,
who usually is some powerful Kurdish chief. Either
in consequence of his power, or by means of bribes,
he is secure from interference on the part of the
government. He collects the amount due the government
and then takes for himself as much as he
chooses, his own will or an exhausted threshing-floor
being the only limit to his rapacity.</p>

<p class='c011'>While he is collector for these villages they are
considered as belonging to him. During the year
his followers pay frequent visits to the villages.
They are ignorant and brutal, and on such visits, as
also when collecting taxes, they treat the villagers
with the utmost severity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“IV. All the above assessors and collectors—and
they are many, a different one for each kind of tax,
personal, house and land, sheep, tobacco, etc.—on
their visits to the villages, take with them <em>a retinue
of servants and soldiers, who, with their horses, must
be kept at the expense of the village, thus entailing
a very heavy additional burden upon them</em>. Soldiers
and servants sent to the villagers to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>collections, very naturally take something for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All the preceding testimony refers to regions where
Jacobite and Nestorian Christians predominate and
thus prove that Armenians are by no means the only
sufferers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same state of affairs was found by Mrs.
Bishop, who made investigations on the ground five
years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the whole, the same condition of alarm prevails
among the Armenians as I witnessed previously
among the Syrian<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> <em>rayahs</em>. It is more than
alarm, it is <em>abject terror</em>, and not without good
reason. In plain English, general lawlessness prevails
over much of this region. Caravans are stopped
and robbed, travelling is, for Armenians, absolutely
unsafe, sheep and cattle are being driven off, and
outrages, which it would be inexpedient to narrate,
are being perpetrated. Nearly all the villages have
been reduced to extreme poverty, while at the same
time they are squeezed for the taxes which the
Kurds have left them without the means of paying.</p>

<p class='c011'>The repressive measures which have everywhere
followed ‘the Erzerum troubles’ of last June [1890]—the
seizure of arms, the unchecked ravages of the
Kurds, the threats of the Kurdish Beys, who are
boldly claiming the sanction of the government for
their outrages, the insecurity of the women, and a
dread of yet worse to come—have reduced these
peasants to a pitiable state.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Through the influence of the British Ambassador
at Constantinople Mrs. Bishop was allowed to state
the situation to the Grand Vizier in person, and on
arriving in England she presented a detailed statement
of facts to the Foreign Office and also to a
Parliamentary Committee.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the recent outrages in Sassoun are conspicuous
by their extent rather than character, the following
incident, which came within the author’s own
knowledge, on the ground at the time, will show.
In June, 1893, four young Armenians and their
wives, living only two miles from the city of Van,
where the Governor and a large military force reside,
were picking herbs on the hillside. They carefully
kept together and intended to return before night.
They were observed by a band of passing Kurds,
who, in broad daylight, fell upon the defenceless
party, butchered the young men, and, as to the
brides, it is needless to relate further. The villagers
going out the next day found the four bodies, not
simply dead, but slashed and disfigured almost beyond
recognition. They resolved to make a desperate
effort to let their wrongs at least be known.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hastily yoking up four rude ox carts, they placed
on each the naked remains of one of the victims,
with his distracted widow sitting by the side, shorn
of her hair in token of dishonor. This gruesome
procession soon reached the outskirts of the city,
where it was met by soldiers sent to turn it back.
The unarmed villagers offer no resistance, but declare
their readiness to perish if not heard. The soldiers
shrink from extreme measures that might cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>trouble among the thirty thousand Armenians of
Van, who are now rapidly gathering about the scene.
The Turkish bayonets retreat before the bared
breasts of the villagers. With ever increasing
numbers, but without tumult, the procession passed
before the doors of the British and Russian Vice-Consulates,
of the Persian Consul-General, the Chief
of Police and other high officials, till it paused before
the great palace of the Governor.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this point Bahri Pasha, who is still Governor,
stuck his head out of the second-story window and
said: “I see it. Too bad! Take them away and
bury them. I will do what is necessary.” Within
two days some Kurds were brought in, among whom
were several who were positively identified by the
women; but, upon their denying the crime, they
were immediately released and escaped. The utter
hopelessness of securing any justice was so apparent,
and experience had so often demonstrated the danger
of arousing the Kurds to greater atrocity by
further efforts to punish them, that the case was
dropped and soon forgotten in the callousness produced
by other cases of frequent occurrence. The
system of mail inspection is so effective (all letters
of subjects must be handed in open at the post-office)
and the danger of reporting is so great that I doubt
that any account of this incident has ever been
given to the civilized world. This case was doubtless
reported by the former British Vice-Consul, unless
he was busy hunting, and, as usual, was buried in the
archives of the Foreign Office for “state reasons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A foreign physician, never a missionary, and now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>out of the country, told me that during a large practice
of a year and a half in Armenia, while using
every effort to save life, only one case was remembered
of regret by the doctor for a fatal ending,—so
sad is the lot of those who survive. This instance
will explain the strange statement. A call came to
see a young man sent home from prison in a dying
condition. He could not speak, and had to be nourished
for days by artificial feeding, because his stomach
could not retain food. Constant and skilful care
for a month brought him back to life, from the condition
to which his vile, dark, unventilated cell and
scanty food had brought him. As soon as the police
learned of his unexpected recovery, he was seized and
re-imprisoned, though an only son, with a widowed
mother and sister dependent upon him. When
last heard of, he was still “awaiting trial.” Such
confinement is a favorite method of intimidation
and blackmail in the case of the innocent, and, in
the case of the guilty, amounts to punishment without
the cost and labor involved in proving the guilt
and securing sentence by legal process.</p>

<p class='c011'>From my own house in Van goods of considerable
value were stolen in November, 1893. Though I
had good clews to the guilty parties and would have
been glad to recover my property, I felt constrained
to use every precaution <em>not</em> to let the affair come to
the ears of the police, lest they should use it as a
pretext for searching the houses of many innocent
Armenians, in the hope of finding a letter, book, or
weapon of some kind, which might serve as an excuse
for imprisonment. This course exposed me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>further attacks of thieves and necessitated a night
watchman.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>WHY ARE THESE FACTS NOT KNOWN?</h3>

<p class='c020'>The ignorance and incredulity of the public is a
most significant commentary on the situation. But
the explanation is simple. In the nature of the case,
in reports of outrages where the victims or their
friends are still within the clutches of the Turks, all
names of individuals and often the exact locality
must be concealed. Such anonymous accounts
naturally arouse little interest, and, of course, cannot
be verified. The former British Consul-General at
Erzerum, Mr. Clifford Lloyd, showed me at that
place many such reports sent to him by members of
Parliament for verification. He was unable to verify
them, but said that the reports gave a correct impression
of the condition of the country. At that
very time, October, 1890, Mr. Lloyd called attention,
in an official dispatch, published in the “<cite>Blue-Books</cite>,” to:</p>

<p class='c026'>“1. The insecurity of the lives and properties of the
Armenians. 2. The insecurity of their persons, and
the absence of all liberty of thought and action. 3.
The unequal status held by the Christian as compared
with the Mussulman in the eyes of the government.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On this subject there are five channels of varying
market value. First. Consular reports, meagre
and often inaccessible. The United States has no
consuls in Armenia, and consequently no “official”
knowledge of its condition. European consuls are
expected to report nothing that they are not absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>sure of, and are given to understand, both by
their own governments and by that of Turkey, that
they must not make themselves obnoxious in seeking
information. They are, at best, passive until their
aid is sought, and then alarm the suppliants by refusing
to touch the case unless allowed to use names.
Second. Missionaries, whose mouths are sealed.
They would be the best informed and most trustworthy
witnesses. But they feel it their first duty to
safeguard the great benevolent and educational interests
committed to them by not exciting the suspicion
and hostility of the government. Their
position is a delicate one, conditional on their neutrality,
like that of officers of the Red Cross Society
in war. Third. Occasional travellers, whose first
impressions are also often their last and whose hasty
jottings are likely to be very interesting and may be
very misleading. Not so in the case of Mrs. Isabella
Bird Bishop, whom I had the pleasure of meeting
there, and who embodied the result of her careful investigations
in an article entitled, “The Shadow of
the Kurd” in <cite>The Contemporary Review</cite>.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Fourth.
Much evidence from Armenian sources, which is
often unjustly discredited as being the exaggeration,
if not fabrication, of “revolutionists who seek a
political end.” Fifth. Turkish official reports, often
obtained by corrupt or violent means, or invented to
suit the circumstances. Though the financial credit
of the Ottoman Government was long ago exhausted,
there are some well meaning people who still place
confidence in Turkish explanations and promises.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h3 class='c018'>WHAT CAN BE DONE?</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The scope of this book does not permit a discussion
of even the Armenian phase of the Eastern
question, beyond a bare reference to its possible
three-fold solution. There is, first, Russian annexation,
a step for which the sufferers themselves are
praying, and which Russia is prepared to execute at
a moment’s notice. If this were the only alternative
from present conditions, it should be universally
welcomed. Russia is crude, stupid, and, in certain
aspects, brutal, but she is not decrepit, debauched,
and doting like official Turkey. The diseases of the
“Sick Man” are incurable and increasing, while the
bully of the North is young, of good blood, and with
an energy suggestive of a force of nature. Russia
shaves half the head of seceders from the Orthodox
Church and transports them. Turkey, with more
tact, quietly “disposes” of converts from Islam,
many of whom would step forth if the prospect were
less than death. The Jewish question, from the
Russian standpoint, is largely a social and industrial
one, like the Chinese question in the United States.
When the writer passed from Turkish Armenia into
the Caucasus, it was from a desert to a garden;
from danger to perfect security; from want and sorrow
to plenty and cheer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Until lately, thousands of Turkish Armenians have
been in the habit of crossing the Russian border in
spring, earning good wages during the summer, and
returning to spend the winter with their families.
This has opened their eyes to the contrast between
the two lands and turned their hearts to Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The second solution is Armenian autonomy, like
that of Bulgaria, the fond dream of those who
ignore the geographical difficulties, the character,
and distribution of the population, and the temper
of Russia and other powers by whom it would have
to be established and maintained.</p>

<p class='c011'>The only other method is radical and vigorous administrative
reforms, which the European powers
should initiate, and report to Turkey, instead of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</span></i>, as arranged in Article LXI. of the Berlin
Treaty. These “Christian nations” have for sixteen
years violated most sacred treaty obligations,
and England a special guarantee for such reforms.
While attended with difficulties, this is the most
desirable solution, and is favored by the great mass
of Armenians throughout Turkey, by the Anglo-Armenian
Association,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> founded by Prof. James
Bryce, M.P., and by the Phil-Armenic Society in this
country.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The real spirit and aim of the Armenian
race, as a whole, is unfortunately obscured, in the
mind of the public, by utterances and acts of a few
irresponsible Armenian hot-heads, who have imbibed
nihilistic views in Europe, and are trying, in a very
bungling way, to apply them.</p>

  <h2 id='iv' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>OTTOMAN PROMISES AND THEIR FULFILMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Imperial edicts of toleration, and promises of
reform on the part of the Sublime Porte, have
been very numerous, and have served Turkey
well as political expedients. Their value is that of
so much dust thrown in the eyes of Europe when
her aid or her mercy was needful. As these reforms
have all been promised under pressure, they have
likewise been abandoned just so fast and so far
as the pressure has been removed. In many cases
there has been serious retrogression. The sow that
is washed is forever returning to wallow in the mire.
It is as true of the “Sick Man” as of him out of
whom seven devils were cast, that the last state of
that man is worse than the first. This is emphatically
so in regard to the freedom of the press, the
curtailment of religious and educational privileges,
and the safety of the lives and property of
Christians.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is a partial list of Turkish promises
which have been broken in whole or in part, with
the circumstances under which they were made.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. In 1829, by the Treaty of Adrianople at the
close of a war with Russia, Turkey promised to reform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>in her treatment of Orthodox Christians, and
acknowledged Russia’s right to interfere in their
behalf.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>2. In 1839 Sultan Abd-ul-Medjid, in order to enlist
European sympathy and aid—when the victorious
Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha was threatening
Constantinople—issued an Imperial rescript,
the Hatti Sherif, in which he promised to protect
the life, honor, and property of all his subjects irrespective
of race or religion.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. In 1844 the same Sultan Abd-ul-Medjid gave a
solemn pledge that thenceforth no apostate from
Mohammedanism <em>who had formerly been a Christian</em>
should be put to death. This pledge was extorted
from the Sultan by the Ambassador of Great Britain,
supported by those of other Powers, after the public
execution in Constantinople of a young Armenian,
Ovagim, who had declared himself a Mohammedan,
but who afterwards bravely maintained his Christian
profession in the face of torture and death. Since
that time many Moslems even have embraced Christianity,
and have been put out of the way, quietly in
most cases.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. In 1850 the same Sultan, on the demand of the
same Powers, in view of the continued and fierce persecution
of the Protestant subjects of the Porte,
granted the latter a charter, guaranteeing them liberty
of conscience and all the rights as a distinct
civil community, which had been enjoyed by the
other Christian communities of the empire. But to
this day the numerous Protestants of Stamboul have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>never been allowed to erect even <em>one church</em>, although
they have owned a site and had the necessary funds,
and been petitioning for a firman to build for fifteen
years.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The Greek Protestants of Ordoo, who have
a church, are not allowed to worship in it. There
are many other flagrant violations of this charter.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. In 1856, after the Crimean War, Sultan Abd-ul-Medjid,
to anticipate demands which he knew would
be included in the Treaty of Paris then being drawn
up, issued the Imperial edict known as the Hatti
Humayoun. This edict not only promised perfect
equality of civil rights to all subjects of the Porte,
but also added: “As all forms of religion are and
shall be freely professed in my dominions, no subject
of my empire shall be hindered in the exercise of the
religion that he professes, nor shall he in any way be
annoyed on this account.” But as the interpretation
and enforcement of this edict has remained absolutely
in the hands of the Turkish Government, it is needless
to add that it has been a dead letter.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>6. In 1878 the Anglo-Turkish Convention, entered
into just before the Treaty of Berlin, included these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>words in its First Article: “His Imperial Majesty,
the Sultan, promises to England to introduce necessary
reforms, to be agreed upon later between the
two Powers, into the government and for the protection
of the Christian and other subjects of the Porte
in these territories [Armenia]; and in order to enable
England to make necessary provision for executing
her engagement [the keeping of Russia out of Armenia],
His Imperial Majesty, the Sultan, further consents
to assign the Island of Cyprus to be occupied and
administered by England.” Comment unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>7. In July, 1878, by the Treaty of Berlin, religious
liberty and the public exercise of all forms of religion
were guaranteed in separate articles to the people
of Bulgaria, Eastern Roumelia, Montenegro, Servia,
Roumania, and finally to all subjects of the Porte in
every part of the Ottoman Empire. Cases of glaring
violation of the principle of religious liberty may be
found in Appendix <a href='#C'>C</a>. on <em>The Censorship of the Press</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Sixty-first Article of the same treaty reads
thus: “The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out,
without further delay, the improvements and reforms
demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee
their security against the Circassians and Kurds. It
will periodically make known the steps taken to this
effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What the condition of Turkey was three years
later, not simply in Armenia, but throughout Asia
Minor, is shown by a report of Mr. Wilson, British
Consul-General in Anatolia.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There has probably never been a time in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the prestige of the Courts has fallen so low, or in
which the administration of justice has been so venal
and corrupt. The most open and shameless bribery
is practised from highest to lowest; prompt, even-handed
justice for rich and poor alike is unknown;
sentence is given in favor of the suitor who ‘places’
his money most judiciously; imprisonment or freedom
has in many places become a matter of bribery;
robbers, when arrested, are protected by members of
the Court, who share their spoil; a simple order may
send an innocent man to prison for months; crime
goes unpunished, and all manner of oppression and
injustice is committed with impunity. The Cadis,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
especially those in the cazas,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> are, as a rule, ignorant
men, with no education, knowing little of law, except
the Sheri, on which they base their decisions, and
sometimes not overmuch of that. As to the members,
it is sufficient to say that they are nearly all
equally ignorant of law, and that probably not twenty-five
per cent. of them can write Turkish, or read the
sentences to which they attach their seals. In the
Commercial Courts, the Presidents are frequently
entirely ignorant of the duties which they have to
perform. The low pay of the Cadis, the short term—two
years—during which they hold their appointments,
and the manner in which they obtain them,
render the receipt of bribes almost a necessity. The
first thought of a Cadi who buys an appointment in
the provinces is to recoup himself for his outlay;
the second, to obtain enough money to purchase a
new place when his term of office is finished. Even
under this system men are to be found who refuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>to receive bribes; and there are others who, whilst
giving way to temptation, deplore the necessity to
do so.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The sequel to the Treaty of Berlin is found in
the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The non-fulfilment of Ottoman promises in regard
to Christian subjects, and the frequent massacres of
the latter are an exact fulfilment of</p>

<h3 class='c018'>THE OFFICIAL PRAYER OF ISLAM</h3>
<p class='c027'>which is used throughout Turkey, and daily repeated
in the Cairo “Azhar” University by ten thousand
Mohammedan students from all lands. The following
translation is from the Arabic:</p>

<p class='c026'>“I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, [the <em>rejeem</em>]
the accursed. In the name of Allah the Compassionate,
the Merciful! O Lord of all Creatures!
O Allah! Destroy the infidels and polytheists, thine
enemies, the enemies of the religion! O Allah!
Make their children orphans, and defile their
abodes! Cause their feet to slip; give them and
their families, their households and their women,
their children and their relations by marriage, their
brothers and their friends, their possessions and
their race, their wealth and their lands, as booty to
the Moslems, O Lord of all Creatures!”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>All who do not accept Mohammed are included
among “the infidels” referred to in the prayer.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h2 id='v' class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE OUTCOME OF THE TREATY OF BERLIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>It is quite needless to remark that Turkey, instead
of doing anything to improve the condition of
the Armenians, has done much to make it
worse during the past fifteen years. The question
now arises, what have the Powers signatory to the
Berlin Treaty done to compel the Sublime Porte
“to carry out the improvements and reforms”
demanded in the Sixty-first Article? And what
steps has Great Britain taken in addition, to discharge
the additional obligation for the improvement
of Armenia which she assumed by the so-called
Cyprus Convention?</p>

<p class='c011'>We find that in November, 1879, the English
Government, seeing that matters throughout Asia
Minor were really going from bad to worse, went
the length of ordering an English squadron to the
Archipelago for the purpose of a naval demonstration.
The Turkish Government was greatly excited,
and with a view to getting the order countermanded,
made the fairest promises.</p>

<p class='c011'>But England was not the only Power aroused. On
June 11, 1880, an Identical Note of the Great
Powers demanded the execution of the clauses of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the Treaty of Berlin which had remained in suspense.
In the conclusion of the Identical Note a clear
recognition is made of the fact that <em>the interest of
Europe, as well as that of the Ottoman Empire, requires
the execution of the Sixty-first Article of the Treaty of
Berlin, and that the joint and incessant action of the
Powers can alone bring about this result</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>On July 5th, the Turkish Foreign Minister sent a
Note in reply to the representatives of the Powers.
“It is of great length and small real value, except as
combining in a remarkable degree the distinguishing
characteristics of modern Ottoman diplomacy,
namely, first, great facility in assimilating the administrative
and constitutional jargon of civilized
countries; second, consummate cunning in concealing
under deceptive appearances the barbarous reality
of deeds and intentions; third, cool audacity in
making promises which there is neither the power
nor desire to make good; and, finally, a paternal and
oily tone, intended to create the impression that the
Turkish Government is the victim of unjust prejudices
and odious calumnies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as the reply of the Porte was received,
Earl Granville sent copies to the British Consuls in
Asia Minor, inviting observations thereon. Eight
detailed replies to this request are published in the
Blue-Book.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> They concur in a crushing condemnation
of the Ottoman Government.</p>

<p class='c011'>These conclusions, moderately and very diffusely
expressed in diplomatic phraseology, are reflected in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the Collective Note which was sent on Sept. 11, 1880,
to the Sublime Porte by the Ambassadors of the
Great Powers. On October 3d, without making the
slightest references to censures which had been
addressed to it, and even appearing completely to
ignore the Collective Note, the Porte, assuming a
haughty tone, merely notified the Powers of what it
intended to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a Circular of the 12th of January, 1881, Earl
Granville tried again to induce the other five Powers
to join in further representations to the Sublime
Porte on the subject. But the other Powers seem
to have thought that the diplomatic comedy had
gone far enough, and sent evasive answers. Prince
Bismarck expressed the opinion that there would be
“serious inconvenience” in raising the Armenian
question, and France hid behind Germany. Such
action by the powers had been anticipated by the
British Ambassador at Constantinople, Mr. Goschen,
who had already written to Earl Granville: “If they
[the Powers] refuse, or give only lukewarm support,
the responsibility will not lie with Her Majesty’s
Government.” The whole correspondence was simply
a matter of form.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> I have condensed this outline
of events since the Treaty of Berlin from <cite>Armenia,
the Armenians, and the Treaties</cite>,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> following as far as
possible the words of the writer, M. G. Rolin-Jaequemyns,
a high authority on International Law.</p>

<p class='c011'>From 1881 to the present time, almost without
exception, England, on her part, has allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>no mention in her Blue-Books of the manner in
which her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</span></i> and those of Europe have been
treated. Her energies have seemed to be devoted
to stifling the ever-increasing cry of despair from
Armenia, instead of attempting her rescue or relief.
The other Powers are only less guilty, in proportion
as they have done less to perpetuate Ottoman misrule,
and have made less pretence of sympathy and
help for the oppressed. Freeman says of England,</p>

<p class='c011'>“By waging a war on behalf of the Turk, by signing
a treaty which left the nations of Southeastern
Europe [and Asia Minor] at the mercy of the Turk, by
propping up the wicked power of the Turk in many
ways, we have done a great wrong to the nations
which are under his yoke; and that wrong which we
have ourselves done it is our duty to undo.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is thus clearly seen that both the Sixty-first
Article of the Berlin Treaty, and the Cyprus Convention
as well, have been of positively no value in
securing for the Armenians any of the reforms which
were therein recognized as imperatively called for
and guaranteed. It is also clear that the condition
of Armenia, and of Turkey as a whole, is even vastly
worse and more hopeless than it was twenty years ago.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>PROFESSOR MINAS TCHÉRAZ.<br /><br />Present at the Berlin Congress.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This condition, I further maintain, is in large
measure directly attributable to those treaties themselves
and to the attitude subsequently assumed by
the Powers which signed them. It is said that the
Armenians have brought trouble on themselves, by
stirring up the Turks. I ask what stirred the Armenians
up? It was primarily the Sixty-first Article
of the Treaty of Berlin. Many a time has that
precious paragraph been quoted to me in the wilds
of Kurdistan by common Armenian artisans and
ignorant villagers. They had welcomed it as a
second evangel, and believed the word of England
as they did the gospels. <em>It was that Article which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>roused them from the torpor of centuries.</em> They saw
Bulgaria rise from her blood and shame and enter
on a career of honor and prosperity under the ægis
of European protection. Is it surprising that hopes
and aspirations have been born anew in the heart of
the Armenian race—a people not inferior to the
Bulgarians and in many respects more talented?</p>

<p class='c011'>I have rarely found it difficult to persuade intelligent
Armenians that an autonomous Armenia is
impracticable. But I have never been able to convince
one of them that the course of England and
the other powers has been anything but one of selfishness,
jealousy, and dishonor as far as fulfilment
of their treaty obligations is concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>During a residence of four years in Eastern Turkey
I noticed a marked and rapid alienation of Armenian
sentiment from England in favor of Russia, who
now seems to them the only source of succor. <em>They</em>
see in England only a dog in the manger.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is another sequel to the Berlin Treaty and
to the attitude of the powers, namely, its effect on
the Turks themselves. The natural enmity and contempt
of the Moslem rulers and population generally
for the Christian subjects has been greatly
increased by reason of the pressure which foreign
Powers have occasionally brought to bear on the
Turks in order to procure relief for the Christian.
To be sure the only hope of such relief is from without.
But the pressure should not be of a petty,
nagging and galling nature. This is worse than
nothing. <em>What is needed is prompt, decisive, and final
action.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>And things have now arrived at such a pass that
in such action lies the only hope of preventing a terrible
catastrophe, which will eclipse even the massacres
of Sassoun. The wheels of progress will not go
backward except as they are broken. The Christians
of Armenia can be exterminated, but it is too
late for them to accept slavery or Islam. They may
be slaughtered like sheep, but they will not all die
like dogs. The revolutionary movement, as it is
called, is thus far nothing but a blind turning of the
worm. It is ill considered, without resources, reckless,
and foreign to the real spirit, objects, and methods
of the Armenians on Turkish soil. It is not
denied that there are a few Armenians in Europe
who, in despair and for lack of better teaching, have
imbibed Nihilistic views and are trying, in a very
bungling way, to apply them. They are hated by the
vast majority of Armenians in Turkey. They are
related to the question at issue in the same way and
degree as train wreckers and box-car burners were to
the industrial problem during the riots of Chicago
in July last, and deserve the same treatment. The
Turks take great pains to thrust them into public
notice, as a cloak for themselves, and with good success.
The Turkish Government and its partisans, in
order to conceal the real character of the massacre
in Sassoun, has made persistent, extensive, and dishonorable
use of a letter by the first President of
Robert College, Constantinople, Dr. Cyrus Hamlin,
written December 23, 1894. Dr. Hamlin’s vigorous
and indignant protest may be found in Appendix <a href='#C'>C</a>.</p>

<p>ZEIBEK, TURKISH SOLDIER, “IRREGULAR.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The idea of Armenian revolution is a new thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>in the history of that peaceable race, which has
quietly submitted for centuries to the yoke of the
Turk. But it is the natural outcome of the horrible
situation in Armenia since the Treaty of Berlin, and
the disease is bound
to grow more virulent
and contagious
until the European
doctors apply vigorous
and radical treatment
to the “Sick
Man.” It is difficult
to see how anything
but a surgical operation
can be helpful.
The knife has frequently
been used in
the case of this incurable
patient during
the present century,
and always with excellent
results, as for
instance in the case
of Greece, Lebanon,
Bulgaria, Boznia-Herzegovina,
and
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c011'>A situation in many
respects parallel to that in Armenia existed until
lately in Bosnia and Herzegovina. How quickly
and completely that difficult problem has been
solved, is narrated by M. de Blowitz in the October,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>1894, issue of <cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite>, from which
I condense in his own words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The orders, given after the taking over of the
country, to surrender all arms or to destroy them, was
given a sweeping application. Yet, before the victorious
entry of the Austro-Hungarians, each Bosnian
each Herzegovinian, was a walking arsenal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-day weapons and ambuscades are things of
the romantic past. Twelve years have sufficed, under
M. de Kallay’s administration, not only to remove
all traces of the wild, inhospitable, inaccessible
Bosnia of which I have been speaking, but indeed
and especially to banish even the memory of those
dark days of strenuous battle, and to wipe away
from the hearts of both invader and invaded all
traces of the hate which then animated them. In
the year 1882, the superior administration of the two
provinces (Bosnia and Herzegovina) passed into the
hands of the Minister of Finance of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, who was then, and who is still,
M. de Kallay. From this moment all is changed.
The powers given to the new administration are
almost unlimited. The civil element has been substituted
for the military element, and pacification has
succeeded conquest. The greatest effort is made to
reassure all minds. Not a single minaret has disappeared,
not a <em>muezzin</em> is deprived of his resources.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A recent writer wisely says that “the Armenian
question, if it ever be settled at all, must be taken
out of the Turk’s hands, whether he like it or not....
And we have an opportunity now, which
may never come our way again, of settling a difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>which, if allowed to develop much longer,
will prove more fruitful of mischief than any with
which we have been confronted for a generation or
more.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

in his <cite>Armenia and the Campaign
of 1877</cite><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> wrote words

I condense:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naturally, since I have been
here I have had many, very
many, opportunities of conversing
with Turkish officers and
men on the so-called Eastern
Question; and the consequence
is that, arriving in the country
a strong philo-Turk, deeply
impressed with the necessity of
preserving the ‘integrity of the
Empire’ in order to uphold
‘British interests,’ I now fain
would cry with Mr. Freeman:
‘Perish, British interests, perish
our dominion in India, rather
than that we should strike a blow
on behalf of the wrong against the right!’<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no finer race in the world than the Turk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>proper. Brave, honest, industrious, truthful, frugal,
kind-hearted, and hospitable, all who <em>know</em> the
Osmanli speak well of him. He is as much oppressed
by the curse of misgovernment as his Christian fellow-subject;
and had the members of the Eastern Question
Association as keen a sense of justice as they
have love of writing, they would long ago have obliterated
the word ‘Christian’ from their lengthy documents,
and striven to ameliorate the condition of the
lower orders of the subjects of the Porte, downtrodden
as they are by an effete section of the
Mohammedan race, who have degenerated in mind,
body, and estate, since coming in contact with
Western civilization.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not for one moment mean to deny that there
are honest, energetic Turks, capable of exercising
their talents for their country’s good; but these men
are powerless. The vital powers of the nation are
so sapped by centuries of misrule, the minds of the
majority are so imbued with the belief that all ideas
not born of Moslem brains and sanctified by Moslem
usage are false, and to be scorned, that were any
honest-minded gentleman to rise to power, and endeavor
to check the present system of misgovernment,
he would not remain in office one week.

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Church and State are one and inseparable in

Calif of the Mohammedan religious world.
He cannot abdicate either office, if he would, without

lies the secret of the present Sultan’s policy, which
seems suicidal on general principles of government.
He has, on the one hand, been lavish in the building
and repairing of mosques, and in establishing Moslem
schools throughout his dominions. On the other
hand, he has infringed and ignored the ancient rights
and privileges of the Christian Patriarchates which
were guaranteed by Mohammed II., and have hitherto
been regarded as sacred. He has blocked the erection
of new Christian schools and churches, and even
the repairing of such as are falling into decay.
There were formerly thousands of non-Moslems in
civil positions, faithfully serving the government;
under the new régime, however, they have been
systematically removed and excluded. And why
has all this been done? Because the Sultan is a
good conscientious Mohammedan, it is only fair to
believe. Even if he were not a sincere believer, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>would still feel compelled to adopt the same course,
as a matter of internal political necessity. The
Moslem population look to him as the Defender of
the Faith, girded with the sword of the Prophet.
He feels it imperative at all hazards to regain lost
prestige over his fanatical subjects, especially in the
south, where rumblings of discontent and disloyalty
are ominous.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Let us be reasonable and practical. Why longer
exact or accept from the Sultan promises which he
cannot make without doing violence to his own
conscience and to his office, and which he cannot
execute without imperilling his throne? You might
as well ask the Pope to abandon the doctrines of
temporal sovereignty and of infallibility, which to
him are fundamental. If the situation in Turkey demands
that anything be done, and if the rest of
humanity and civilization have any responsibility in
the matter, let practical statesmen proceed to business.
All hope of reform from within depends on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the distrustful, distracted, hoodwinked Sultan, who
is clearly, in the circumstances, a helpless and pitiable
object. But he should no more be allowed to stand
in the way of the emancipation of Turkey, than the
Pope was allowed to impede the making of Italy.
“The Prisoner of the Vatican” has still abundant
scope for his great and beneficent spiritual projects;
and the Captive at Yildiz Palace—for such he has for
years constituted himself—may also be allowed a
sphere in which his personal virtues and ability shall
shine forth, unobscured by the clouds and darkness
that surround him now. He certainly would be better
off, and his subjects also—Moslem no less than
Christian.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shrieks of ten thousand slaughtered Armenians
pierce for the moment above the groans of
others. But it should not be forgotten that all the
races in Turkey are under the same curse, and that
the present is a chance to help them as well as the
Armenians.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to the Koran, which is the basis and
ultimate authority of Mohammedan law—Code
Napoleon, treaty stipulations, and Imperial <em>Iradés</em>
notwithstanding,—the whole non-Moslem population
of Turkey are outlaws. The millions of ancient,
hereditary inhabitants, whether Greek, Armenian,
Nestorian, Jacobite, Jew, or Syrian, are considered
aliens. Their legal status is that of prisoners of war,
with corresponding rights and responsibilities.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Not
one of them is expected or even allowed to serve in
the army. Non-Moslems, whose services are indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>to the government, are, in rare cases, put in
civil offices, especially financial, for which no Mohammedan
of sufficient integrity or ability can be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>It cannot be denied that the above is true in
theory, and it is equally true that the theory is carried
out so far as fear of intervention by Christian
nations permits.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in this hour, when our hearts are stirred by the
lot of our co-religionists under the Crescent, let us not
forget that the Moslem population almost equally is
cursed and impoverished by Turkish misrule, venality,
and taxation. They drink the cup of woe, all
but the more bitter dregs of religious persecution,
which is reserved for Christian lips. Their benumbed
condition, natural stolidity, and unquestioning
obedience to Islam, a creed whose cardinal principle
is submission,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> accounts for the fact that they
do not appear as a factor of the problem. Yet even
Mohammedans often secretly come pleading that
Europe take some interest in their case too. In the
name of humanity, yes, of Christianity, let them not
be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An Eastern Resident,” writing from Constantinople,
in an article entitled “Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid,”
in <cite>The Contemporary Review</cite>, January, 1895, gives an
able analysis of the Sultan’s position and policy,
showing at the same time great appreciation of His
Majesty as a man. His position and relations to the
Sublime Porte are not well understood by the public,
and could hardly be better stated than in these
extracts:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
<img src='images/i_091.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>H. I. M. ABD-UL-HAMID KHAN, THE SULTAN OF TURKEY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“So far as we can judge, the Sultan is a sincere
and honest Mohammedan, and regards himself as a
true Caliph—a successor of the Prophet—the chief
defender of the faith, under God the absolute arbiter
of its destinies. He has undoubtedly done his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>best to reconcile the interests of the Caliphate with
those of the Empire....</p>

<p class='c011'>“In one particular it [the policy of the Sultan] is
condemned by most enlightened Mohammedans as
strongly as by Christians. His attempt to concentrate
the whole administration of the Empire in his
own hands has led to the establishment of a dual
government—that of the Palace and the Porte. The
whole machinery of a government exists at the Porte.
There are Ministers and fully organized departments.
There is a Council of Ministers and a Council of
State. All business is supposed to pass through
their hands, and the whole administration is supposed
to be subordinate to them. All is, of course,
subject to the supreme will of the Sultan, but his
official advisers and his official agents are at the
Porte.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In fact, however, there is another government at
the Palace of Yildiz, more powerful than the official
government, made up of chamberlains, mollahs,
eunuchs, astrologers, and nondescripts, and supported
by the secret police, which spares no one from the
Grand Vizier down. The general policy of the Empire
is determined by this government, and the most important
questions of state are often treated and
decided, while the highest officials of the Porte are
left in absolute ignorance of what is going on. It is
needless to add that the Porte and the Palace are at
sword’s-point, and block each other’s movements as
far as they can....</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Sultan evidently believes that he is equally
independent of both these governments, and decides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>all questions, great and small, for himself. In form
he does so, but no man can act independently of all
his sources of information, and of the personal influence
of his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</span></i>. Under the present system he
makes himself responsible for every blunder and
every iniquity committed in the Empire, but he has
disgraced three distinguished Grand Viziers for telling
him so, and seems to have no idea of the causes
of the intense dissatisfaction with his government
which prevails among his Mohammedan subjects.
The Turks, as well as the Christians, also condemn
the laws restricting personal freedom, which have
increased in severity every year. In many ways
these laws are more galling to the Turks than the
Christians....</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is another evil connected with this system
which may lead to serious difficulties with foreign
Powers. All foreign relations are supposed to be
managed through the Minister of Foreign Affairs or
the Grand Vizier, but these officials have no power
and but little influence. They can promise nothing
and do nothing. But in all delicate diplomatic questions
it is essential to treat with responsible agents,
and to discuss them with such agents in a way in
which it is impossible to treat with the Sovereign
himself. The present system has been a serious injury
to Turkey. It has roused the hostility of all the
Embassies and led them to feel and report to their
governments, that there is no use in trying to do anything
to save this Empire; that it is hopelessly corrupt,
and the sooner it comes to an end the better
for the world. There is no longer any concerted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>action of Europe at Constantinople for the improvement
of the condition of the people....</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid would come out of his
palace, restore to the Porte its full responsibility,
disband its secret police, trust his Mohammedan subjects,
and do simple justice to the Christians, his life
would be far more secure than it is to-day, with all
precautions; his people and all the world would
recognize the great and noble qualities which they
now ignore, and welcome him as the wisest and best
of all the Sultans....</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sad pity of it is that he will never do it. It
is too late. The influence of the Palace favorites is
too strong. He will appear in history not as the
Sultan who saved the Empire, but as the one who
might have saved it and did not.”</p>

the Porte has called them—in all these

infants, and in each case, by a curious coincidence,
have been non-Mohammedan.</p>

<p class='c011'>In all of these massacres, Turkish military or civil
officers presided and directed the bloody work, as will
be seen by reference to the authorities mentioned.
There have been many other massacres of less than

<p class='c011'>The above figures indicate the extent of the
massacres mentioned. The following extracts reveal
the occasion and manner in which they were carried
out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first extract is in regard to the Greeks, and is
a translation, by Mr. Robert Stein, from the French:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The blow had been long premeditated. Sultan
Mahmoud was in the habit of replying to every success
of the Greek insurgents by ordering massacres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>violations, and enslavement in regions without defense,
where there were none but women, children,
and inoffensive merchants. After the first exploit of
Kanaris, the quiet commercial town of Cydonia had
promptly been burnt. The Turkish admiral was
beaten at Samos; for that reason thirty days were
spent in Cyprus in cutting off heads. The town of
Tripolitza, in the Morea, having been taken by the
Palikares, the inhabitants of Cassandra, in Thrace,
were given up to bands of Arnauts. The Sultan
wished to take new reprisals to terrify the <em>rayas</em>
[Christian subjects], and to cause the nations of
Europe to reflect. He took care not to fix his choice
on Crete, where his <em>nizams</em> would have been received
with gunshots. Chios was an easy prey, and suspected
nothing, having always lived on good terms
with the Porte, and having even refused to take part
in the insurrection of Hellas and the islands. The
Chiotes had always been the gentlest, the most
docile, the most timid of all the <em>rayas</em>. The secret
societies which endeavored to rouse the Greek people
had not even deigned to initiate these islanders in
their projects of national resurrection. On the 8th of
May, 1821, the intrepid Tombasis, with fifteen brigs
from Hydra and ten schooners from Psara, had appeared
before the island, and his patriotic advances
having been ill received, he had retired. The inhabitants
of Chios, in order to give new guaranties
of submission, had sent to the Turks large amounts
of money, numerous hostages, and all their arms;
even the little knives with which they cut their bread
had been taken from them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“At this moment, on Easter Day, 1822, the Capitan-Pasha
anchored in the harbor, with seven ships
and eight frigates. Inasmuch as many of the people,
frightened by the sight of this fleet, had fled to the
mountains, they were made to come down by promises
of safety, and by sending to them some consuls, who
were simple enough to lend themselves in good faith
to this ignoble fraud. The Turkish admiral brought
his executioners with him; <em>bashi-bazouks</em> from
Roumelia, Zeibeks and Yuruks from Asia Minor, the
most ferocious and cowardly to be found in the
empire. The adventurers had come in great numbers,
eager for their prey, attracted by this country,
so rich in harvests, in gold coins, and in women. On
the day fixed for this surprise all this rabble was
crowded into boats, with pistols and knives, and the
carnage began. Whole regiments courageously besieged
villages containing three hundred souls. For
many of them, this slaughter was a great joke, a
gigantic <em>bakshish</em>. They slashed and burned all day;
in the evening they reckoned up the price of the
slaves, the sheep, the goats, all huddled together
pell-mell in the profaned churches. The children and
the women escaped death; their youth and beauty
saved them from the massacre, to deliver them over
at once to outrageous assaults or to reserve them for
the shameful fate of the harem. They were led off
in long troops; they were put on the market and sold
in the bazaars of Smyrna, Constantinople, and Brussa.
Whatever resisted was killed without mercy. At
Mesta, a young girl cried and struggled against an
Arnaut; the madman seized her loosened hair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>turned back the collar, and with a cut of his sabre
severed the pretty head. The person who described
this scene to me saw it with his own eyes.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In regard to the massacre of Nestorians in 1850,
Layard states that after 9000 had been massacred,
“1000 men, women, and children concealed themselves
in a mountain fastness. Beder Khan Beg, an
officer of rank in the employment of the Sultan, unable
to get at them, surrounded the place, and
waited until they should be compelled to yield by
thirst and hunger. Then he offered to spare their
lives on the surrender of their arms and property,
terms ratified by an oath on the Koran. The Kurds
were then admitted to the platform. After they
had disarmed their prisoners they commenced an indiscriminate
slaughter, until, weary of using their
weapons, they hurled the few survivors from the
rocks into the river Zab below. Out of nearly 1000
only one escaped.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In regard to the massacre of Maronites and Syrians
in 1860, the anonymous authority in <cite>The Independent</cite>
goes on to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“After the massacre of June and July, 1860, in
Lebanon and Damascus, under the direction of
Tahir Pasha in Deir el Komr, Osman Beg in Hasbeiya,
Kurshid Pasha in Lebanon, and Ahmed Pasha
in Damascus, a conference was held in Paris, August
3d, by the representatives of Great Britain, Austria,
France, Prussia, Russia, and Turkey. As 11,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Christians had been massacred, the European representatives
called the attention of the Sultan to his
promise in the Treaty of Paris, March 30, 1856,
‘that serious administrative measures should be
taken to ameliorate the condition of the Christian
population of every sect in the Ottoman Empire....’
And then, in the presence and with the consent
of the five aforesaid Christian representatives,
assembled together for the express purpose of taking
measures to stop the effusion of Christian blood in
Syria, caused by the wicked and wilful collusion of
the Sultan’s authorities, the following insult to the
common sense, the feelings, and judgment of Christian
Europe was deliberately penned: ‘The Plenipotentiary
of the Sublime Porte takes note of this
declaration of the representatives of the high contracting
Powers, and undertakes to transmit it to his
court, pointing out <em>that the Sublime Porte has employed,
and continues to employ, her efforts in the sense
of the wish expressed above</em>!’” (Churchill, pp. 220,
221.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Colonel Churchill further says (p. 222):</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nejib Pasha, who was installed Governor of the
Pashalick of Damascus on the restoration of Syria to
the Sultan in 1840, declared to a confidential agent
of the British Consul in that city, not knowing, however,
the character of the person he was addressing,
‘the Turkish Government can only maintain its
supremacy in Syria by cutting down the Christian
sects.’ What Nejib Pasha enounced as a theory,
Kurshid Pasha, after an interval of twenty years,
succeeded in carrying into practice.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The writer in <cite>The Independent</cite> adds:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus we have Nejib Pasha in 1840, Beder Khan
in 1850, Kurshid Pasha in 1860, Chefket Pasha in
1876, and Zekki Pasha in 1894, concurring in this
noble and philanthropic scheme for relieving the
Turkish Empire of its surplus Christian population!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The following facts relate to the terrible atrocities
perpetrated in Bulgaria by Turkish <em>bashi-bazouks</em> in
the spring of 1876. I quote verbatim from the preliminary
report<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> of the Hon. Eugene Schuyler, American
Consul-General, to the Hon. Horace Maynard,
the American Minister, at Constantinople:</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—In reference to the atrocities and massacres
committed by the Turks in Bulgaria, I have the
honor to inform you that I have visited the towns
of Adrianople, Philippopolis, and Tatar-Bazardjik,
and villages in the surrounding districts. From
what I have personally seen, and from the inquiries
I have made, and the information I have received, I
have ascertained the following facts:...</p>

<p class='c011'>“The insurgent villages made little or no resistance.
In many instances they surrendered their
arms upon the first demand. Nearly all the villages
which were attacked by the <em>bashi-bazouks</em> were
burned and pillaged, as were also all those which
had been abandoned by the terrified inhabitants.
The inhabitants of some villages were massacred
after exhibitions of the most ferocious cruelty, and
the violation not only of women and girls, but even
of persons of the other sex. These crimes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>committed by the regular troops as well as by the
<em>bashi-bazouks</em> [irregulars]. The number of villages
which were burned in whole or in part in the districts
of Philippopolis, Roptchus, and Tatar-Bazardjik is at
least sixty-five.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Particular attention was given by the troops to
the churches and schools, which in some cases were
destroyed with petroleum and gunpowder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is difficult to estimate the number of Bulgarians
who were killed during the few days that
the disturbances lasted; but I am inclined to put
15,000 as the lowest for the districts I have named....
This village surrendered, without firing a
shot, after a promise of safety, to the <em>bashi-bazouks</em>,
under command of Ahmed Aga, a chief of the rural
police. Despite his promise, the arms once surrendered,
Ahmed Aga ordered the destruction of
the village and the indiscriminate slaughter of the
inhabitants, about a hundred young girls being reserved
to satisfy the lust of the conqueror before
they too should be killed. Not a house is now
standing in this lovely valley. Of the 8000 inhabitants
not 2000 are known to survive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ahmed Aga, who commanded the massacre, has
since been decorated and promoted to the rank of
<em>yuz bashi</em> [centurian].</p>

<p class='c011'>“These atrocities were clearly unnecessary for the
suppression of the insurrection, for it was an insignificant
rebellion at the best, and the villagers generally
surrendered at the first summons.</p>

tried to cover up these horrible transactions, Premier
Disraeli turning them off with a sneer. The facts, as
unearthed by Consul Schuyler, shook the British
nation like an earthquake, and came near unseating
the Ministry....</p>

<p class='c011'>“A similar investigation was made in the same district
by Mr. J. A. MacGahan, the brilliant correspondent
of the London <cite>Daily News</cite>, who confirms all
that Mr. Schuyler discovered, in a special dispatch
to the <cite>Daily News</cite>, dated Philippopolis, July 28,
1876.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The circumstances and character of the Armenian
massacre of 1894 are found in the first chapter of the
present volume. In regard to this event the writer
in <cite>The Independent</cite> of January 17th above quoted
asks:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will history repeat itself in 1895? Will the
remaining Armenians of Sassoun be so terrorized as
to refuse to testify before a Commission? Undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the facts already known do not force Europe to
place Eastern Asia Minor under a Christian Viceroy
there is little hope that any new facts will influence
them. The dead tell no tales. The living fear to
speak, lest they fall victims to the humane theories
of Beder Khan and Nejib Pasha.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will England now insist upon the protection of
the Christian? She is morally bound to. Four
times has she saved the Ottoman Empire from destruction,
and the civilized world looks to her for a
fulfilment of her high mission in the East.</p>

outrages not included in the above list, which takes
account of no massacres of less than ten thousand
victims at once.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>OUTRAGES IN CRETE IN 1866–7.</h3>

<p class='c020'>On July 21, 1867, the British, Russian, French, and
Italian Consuls at Canea, Crete, sent the following
identical telegram to their several governments:
“Massacres of women and children have broken out
in the interior of the island. The authorities can
neither put down the insurrection nor stay the
course of these atrocities. Humanity would imperatively
demand the immediate suspension of hostilities,
or the transportation to Greece of the women
and children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The number of relieving ships sent to Crete in
obedience to this accord was four French, three
Russian, two Italian, three Austrian, and one Prussian.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c018'>OUTRAGES IN ARMENIA IN 1877.</h3>

<p class='c020'>The writer is C. B. Norman, special correspondent
of <cite>The London Times</cite>, who says in his preface:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In my correspondence to the <cite>Times</cite> I made it

my own personal observation, or facts confirmed by
European evidence.</p>

<p>A HIGHWAY IN ARMENIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“A complete list it is impossible for me to obtain,
but from all sides—from Turk and Armenian alike—I
hear piteous tales of the desolation that reigns
throughout Kurdistan—villages deserted, towns
abandoned, trade at a standstill, harvest ready for
the sickle, but none to gather it in, husbands mourning
their dishonored wives, parents their murdered
children; and this is not the work of a power whose
policy of selfish aggression no man can defend, but
the ghastly acts of Turkey’s irregular soldiery on
Turkey’s most peaceable inhabitants,—acts the perpetrators
of which are well known, and yet are
allowed to go unpunished....</p>

<p class='c011'>“A bare recital of the horrors committed by these
demons is sufficient to call for their condign punishment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The subject is too painful to need any coloring,
were my feeble pen enabled to give it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A few, out of many cases reported by Mr. Norman
are given:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This gang also attacked the village of Kordjotz,
violating the women, and sending off all the virgins
to their hills; entering the church they burned the
Bible and sacred pictures; placing the communion-cup
on the altar, they in turn defiled it, and divided
the church plate amongst themselves....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sheik Obaidulah’s men rivalled their comrades
under the flag of Jelaludeen; these latter operated
between Van and Faik Pasha’s camp. They attacked
and robbed the villages of Shakbabgi and
Adnagantz, carrying off all boys and virgins. At
Kushartz they did the same, and killing 500 sheep,
left them to rot in the streets, and then fired the
place. Khosp, Jarashin, and Asdvadsadsan, Boghatz,
and Aregh suffered in like manner; the
churches were despoiled and desecrated, graves dug
up, young of both sexes carried off, what grain they
could not transport was destroyed, and the inhabitants
driven naked into the fields, to gaze with horror
on their burning homesteads.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c018'>THE MASSACRE OF THE YEZIDIS NEAR MOSUL, 1892.</h3>

<p class='c020'>“The Yezidis are a remnant of a heathen sect, who
have never been converted to the Moslem faith.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Their holy place is not far from the city of Mosul,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>one day’s journey, and their principal villages
are also close by. In the summer of 1892 the Sultan
sent a special officer, called Ferik Pasha, to Mosul to
correct certain abuses in the government, to collect
all back taxes, and to convert the Yezidis. His
authority was absolute, the Vali Pasha of the city
being subject to his orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In reference to his work among the Yezidis, he, it
was generally reported, was to get a certain sum per
capita for every convert made.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He first sent priests among them to convert them
to the “true faith.” They not succeeding, he very
soon gave them the old alternative of the Koran or
the sword. Still not submitting, he sent his soldiers,
under command of his son, who put to the sword all
who, not able to escape, refused to accept Mohammed.
Their villages were burned, many were
killed in cold blood, some were tortured, women
and young girls were outraged or carried off to
harems, and other atrocities, too horrible to relate,
were perpetrated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those who escaped made their way to the mountains
of Sinjar, where, together with their brethren
of the mountains, they intrenched themselves and
successfully defended themselves until the spring of
1893 against the government troops which had been
sent against them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This massacre was reported to the French Government
by M. Siouffi, Consul at that time in Mosul,
and to the English Government by Mr. Parry, who
was in that region under the instructions of the
Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“The Yezidis who remained in their villages on
the plain had Moslem priests set over them to instruct
them in the Moslem faith. They were compelled
to attend prayers and nominally become
Mohammedans; but in secret they practised their
own rites and declared that they were still Yezidis.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>After the massacre of the Yezidi peasants in 1892
an English lady of rank, visiting Mosul, was refused
permission by the Pasha to travel through the
Yezidi district, lest she witness the dreadful results
of the massacre.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The writer in <cite>The Independent</cite> of January 31st,
gives this explanation:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The <em>reason</em> of the recurrence of massacres in
Turkey is the fanatical intolerance of the Moslem
populace and their hatred to Christianity, unrestrained
and often fomented by Turkish officials.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, the ablest and best
friend Turkey ever had, who believed that ‘England
should befriend Turkey in order to reform her,’
says:<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Turkey is weak, fanatical, and misgoverned.
The Eastern question is a fact, a reality of indefinite
duration. Like a volcano it has intervals of rest;
but its outbreaks are frequent, their occasions uncertain,
and their effects destructive’ (p. 6).</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Did not the massacres in Syria in 1860 come
upon us by surprise?... Have we any substantial
security against the recurrence of similar horrors, of
a similar necessity, and of a similar hazard?’ (p. 79).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“‘The position of the Ottoman Empire is one of
natural determination toward a state of exhaustive
weakness’ (p. 97).</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Ill fares the country where neither strong hand
nor willing heart is to be found’ (p. 104).</p>

<p class='c011'>“A joint Commission is now <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> to investigate
the Sassoun massacres. Will any good come from it?
Doubtful. Lord Stratford says (p. 117):</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘We know not how soon or where the kites may
be again collected by a massacre or insurrection....
Such occasional meetings [of Commissions]
have their portion of inconvenience and risk.
Their failure is discreditable; the effect of their success,
at best, transient and partial. The <em>evils</em> they
are meant to correct are themselves the offspring of
one pervading evil, the source of which is in Constantinople.’”</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>ISLAM AS A FACTOR OF THE PROBLEM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>It is with reluctance that I approach this side of
the question. It is not desirable that the subject
be complicated or embittered by religious
animosities. But unfortunately these animosities do
exist and have always formed a primary and essential
feature in all the relations of the Turks with their
Christian subjects. A writer who styles himself
“Diplomatist,” in a recent review article of considerable
merit,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> with a stroke of the pen, disposes of this
phase of the subject by characterizing it as “pure
moonshine.” But real diplomatists do not find it so
easy to dispose of, nor do the great historians treat
it as moonshine. The fanatical gleam that I have
often caught in the eye of Turks and Kurds was
never suggestive to me of the mild rays of the lunar
orb, but seemed rather like a gleam from the political
Crescent, whose baleful influence dominates the East.</p>

<p class='c011'>The question is not concerning the merits of
Mohammed or of Mohammedanism in the abstract.
I have a profound respect for the Prophet of Arabia,
who might have been another Apostle Paul, but for
the fact that the corrupt church of that day failed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to give that young and ardent seeker after God a true
and worthy conception of Christianity. I would fain
admit the high conception of the Mohammedan ideal,
portrayed so skilfully by Mr. R. Bosworth Smith in
his lectures before the Royal Institution of Great
Britain.</p>

<p class='c011'>But such considerations are irrelevant to the present
discussion, which is simply, What are the practical
bearings of Islam upon the question of reform or of
reconstruction in Turkey?</p>

<p class='c011'>As has been already shown in Chapter VI., the
Ottoman Government is a <em>politico-religious system</em>.
This is the necessary constitution of any Mohammedan
sovereign state, but the conception has
special force and vitality in Turkey, whose Sovereign
claims to be the successor of Mohammed, and thus
the Calif of the Mohammedan world. The whole
fabric of the Turkish Empire rests on a religious
foundation. This religious foundation is not the
general religious principle in man, but the particular
form of religion established by Mohammed.</p>

<p class='c011'>To what <em>extent</em>, now, does Islam enter into the
political structure? We find on investigation that
it is part and parcel of the bone and sinew of the
organism in Turkey called the State,—called so by
courtesy on account of its faint analogy to what is
understood in other countries by that name. The
Turkish army is exclusively a Mohammedan army,
the national festivals are Mohammedan festivals, the
official calendar is a Mohammedan calendar, both as
to year and month, the laws are based on the Koran
and Mohammedan tradition, the expounders of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>law are Mohammedan judges, and even testimony is
a religious act of which only true believers are, in the
nature of the case, capable. It is not denied that
the testimony of Christians is allowed to be <em>given</em>
in Turkish courts, but that does not signify that it is
<em>valid</em> evidence in the eyes of the Court, especially
when a Mohammedan is involved. Even the different
formulæ used show this. In the case of a
Mohammedan it is, “His Lordship, So and So, testified
to the face of God”; in the case of a Christian
it is, “Mr. Blank stated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Article 63 of the Treaty of Berlin we read
Turkey’s solemn (it is hard to suppress a smile)
promise to the European Powers in regard to the
rights of Christians before the law: “<em>All shall be
allowed to give evidence before the courts without distinctions
of creed.</em>” The practical application of the
above clause is shown in the official reports of
British Consuls.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Wilson, Consul-General in Anatolia, writes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the greater portion of Anatolia, though Christian
evidence may be received, no weight is attached
to it. When Moslem and Christian evidence are opposed
to each other, the latter is disregarded. For
instance, three Christians are travelling along a road,
and one of them is robbed by a man well known to
all of them; in the action which ensues, the robber
has only to prove an <em>alibi</em> by two Moslem false witnesses
to gain his case.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Mr. Chermside, Vice-Consul at Sivas, writes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As regards the acceptance of Christian testimony,
theoretically is it accepted in all <em>Nizam</em> courts.
Hearing testimony, however, and attaching the relative
importance to it that, from its tenor and consistency,
it is entitled to, are very different matters;
and there is no doubt that, especially in civil cases,
tradition, sympathy, and education prejudice the
<em>Hakim</em><a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> against it—sentimental considerations, however,
are not proof against the love of gain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>According to the latter part of this quotation, the
spirit which animates the courts of Asia Minor may
be defined as fanaticism tempered by corruption.
The following is the opinion of Mr. Everett, Vice-Consul
at Erzerum: “The first consideration of the
administrators of justice is the amount of money
that can be extorted from an individual, and the second
is his creed.” The only doubt as to the morality
of the Turkish magistrates appears to be whether
they are more corrupt than fanatical, or more fanatical
than corrupt.</p>

<p class='c011'>The injustice done to Christians even in commercial
transactions is shown by Mr. Bilotti, Consul at
Trebizond:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Christian evidence is accepted in the town of
Trebizond, but I am assured in the districts, that
though the same principle is admitted, no Mussulman
has ever been condemned on the testimony of
Christians; so much so, that the latter are in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>habit of having their bonds witnessed only by
Mussulmans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Much is said in regard to the truthfulness of the
Turks. Consul-General Wilson writes: “From the
peculiar value of Moslem evidence, most of the false
witnesses are Turks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As a matter of fact, we thus see that the millions
of Christians in Turkey neither are nor can be considered
and treated as citizens of the state, simply
because they do not belong to the religion of the
foreign invaders who rule them. No degree of
loyalty can secure for non-Moslems admission to the
army. Christians are rapidly being excluded from
even the humblest positions in the civil lists also,
except from such as Mohammedans are incompetent
to fill. The status of the Christian before the law is
that of an alien in regard to his own rights, and of a
slave as far as the interests of Mohammedans are
concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet we are told that the Ottoman Turks are
tolerant of the members of other faiths. This is true
in the same sense that the stomach is spoken of as
being “tolerant” of certain easily digestible articles
of food. Yes, so long as Christians submit to all
forms of oppression, and make no claims in regard
to rights which are generally supposed to belong to
all men, they are gladly tolerated.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the discrimination against Christian subjects
is due to their religious belief, is, further, clearly
shown by the fact that Mohammedans, who abandon
the creed of the government, immediately forfeit
their special privileges, and even incur punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>as criminals. Apostacy from Islam is treason to the
Sultan. Converts to Christianity are arrested and
imprisoned. In the rare instances when foreign governments
venture to inquire into such cases, the
Ottoman authorities blandly insist that they care
nothing for the man’s religion, but that he must be
arrested for “avoiding conscription,” or on some
other fictitious charge. He is, thereupon, hurried off
to some distant military post, or finds a living grave
in an unknown dungeon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such is the politico-religious organization called
the Ottoman Government. Can this union of Church
and State be dissolved? It can not be. The bond
which unites them, according to Mohammedan doctors,
is vital, as in the case of the Siamese twins.</p>

<p class='c011'>Inasmuch as the bond cannot be cut, the only remaining
hope must be in improving the health of
the two bodies thus indissolubly united. Unfortunately,
no change can be hoped for in the case of
either part of this dual patient. <em>Mohammedanism at
its birth was a malformation</em>, to say the least, and
will continue so even though restored to a state of
perfect health. In the opinion of every orthodox
Mohammedan, the Koran is a “perfect revelation of
the will of God, sufficient and final,” and “Islam
is a separate distinct, and absolutely exclusive
religion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As attempts are frequently made to convey a contrary
impression on this point, I quote the words of
President George Washburn, of Robert College,
Constantinople, an impartial student of Islam, who
for thirty-five years has observed its practical workings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>in the Ottoman Empire. At the World’s Parliament
of Religions, in Chicago, 1893, he read a
paper on “The Points of Contact and Contrast
between Christianity and Mohammedanism.” His
whole treatment is remarkable for its judicial fairness,
and his paper is commended to the reader
who may desire a brief, comprehensive, and fair
estimate of Islam.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the question whether Mohammedanism has
been in any way modified, since the time of the
Prophet, by its contact with Christianity, Dr. Washburn
thinks that every orthodox Moslem would
answer in the negative. He adds: “It is very important
to bear in mind that there are nominal
Mohammedans who are theists, and others who are
pantheists of the Spinoza type. There are also
some small sects who are rationalists, but after the
fashion of old English Deism rather than of the
modern rationalism. The Deistic rationalism is
represented in that most interesting work of Justice
Ameer Ali, <cite>The Spirit of Islam</cite>. He speaks of Mohammed
as Xenophon did of Socrates, and he
reveres Christ also, but he denies that there was
anything supernatural in the inspiration or lives of
either, and claims that Hanife and the other Imams
corrupted Islam, as he thinks Paul the apostle did
Christianity; but this book does not represent Mohammedanism,
any more than Renan’s <cite>Life of Jesus</cite>
represents Christianity. These small rationalistic
sects are looked upon by all orthodox Moslems as
heretics of the worst description.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the Scriptures of the Old and New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Testaments happen to be mentioned one hundred
and thirty-one times in the Koran, they are only
quoted twice. The fundamental doctrines of Christianity,
such as the Incarnation, the Trinity, the
Atonement, and the Resurrection of Christ are
specifically repudiated in the Koran.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reform of Islam as a system is, therefore, not
within the range of possibility. How about the
reform of the Ottoman Government? On this point
I yield the floor to the great historian E. A. Freeman,
who will close the debate<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are some people who say the Turks are
no doubt very bad, but that the Christians are just
as bad, and have done things just as cruel. Now, as
a matter of fact, this is not true; and, if it were true,
it would be another reason for setting the Christians
free; for if they are as bad as the Turk, it is the
Turk who has caused their badness. While other
nations have been improving, the Turk has kept
them from improving. Take away the Turk who
hinders improvement, and they will improve like the
others. The slave never has the virtues of a freeman;
it is only by setting him free that he can get
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When we point out the evils of the rule of the
Turk, some people tell us that Christian rulers in
past times have done things quite as bad as the
Turks. This is partly true, but not wholly. No
Christian government has ever gone on for so long a
time ruling as badly as the Turk has ruled. But it
is true that Christian governments have in past times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>done particular acts, which were as bad as the acts
of the Turks. But this argument, too, cuts the
other way; for Christian governments have left off
doing such acts, while the Turks go on doing them
still. The worst Christian government is better now
than it was one hundred years ago, or five hundred
years ago. The rule of the Turk is worse now than
it was one hundred years ago, or five hundred years
ago. That is to say, the worst Christian government
can reform, while the Turk cannot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is sometimes said that we ought not to set
free the Christians for fear that they should do some
harm to the Mohammedans who would be left in
their land. Now, if the question were really put,
Shall a minority of oppressors go on oppressing the
people of the land, or shall the majority of the people
of the land turn round and oppress the minority
who have hitherto oppressed them?—this last would
surely be the lesser evil of the two. But there is no
ground for any such fear. No one wishes to hurt
any Mohammedan who will live peaceably and not
hurt Christians. No one wishes that any man,
merely because he is a Mohammedan, should be in
any way worse off than a Christian, or be put under
any disability as compared with a Christian. There is
no reason why he should be. For the Mohammedan
religion, though it does not command that Christians
shall be persecuted, does command that Christians
shall be treated as subjects of Mohammedans. But
the Christian religion in no way commands that
Mohammedan shall be treated as the subject of
Christian. Christians and Mohammedans cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>live together on equal terms under a Mohammedan
government, because the Mohammedan religion
forbids that they should; but Mohammedans
and Christians may perfectly well live together
under a Christian government. They do so under
the governments both of England and of Russia.
The few Mohammedans who are left in Greece
and in Servia are in no way molested; there
are mosques both at Chalkis and at Belgrade. But
it is foolish to argue, as some people do, that because
men of different religions can live together under a
Christian government, therefore they can live together
under a Mohammedan government; for both
reason and the nature of the Mohammedan religion
prove that it is not so....</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Turk came in as an alien and barbarian encamped
on the soil of Europe. At the end of five
hundred years, he remains an alien and barbarian
encamped on soil which he has no more made his
own than it was when he first took Kallipolis. His
rule during all that time has been the rule of
strangers over enslaved nations in their own
land. It has been the rule of cruelty, faithlessness,
and brutal lust; it has not been government,
but organized brigandage. His rule cannot
be reformed. While all other nations get better and
better, the Turk gets worse and worse. And when
the chief powers of Europe join in demanding that
he should make even the smallest reform, he impudently
refuses to make any. If there was anything
to be said for him before the late Conference, there
is nothing to be said for him now. For an evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>which cannot be reformed, there is one remedy only—to
get rid of it. Justice, reason, humanity, demand
that the rule of the Turk in Europe should be
got rid of; and the time for getting rid of it has now
come.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>On the eighty-fifth anniversary of Mr. W. E.
Gladstone’s birth, December 29, 1894, a
deputation of members of the National
Church of Armenia presented to his son, the Rev.
Stephen Gladstone, rector of Hawarden, a silver gilt
chalice for the use of the church, in memory of the
ex-Premier’s sympathy with and assistance to the
Armenian people. On that occasion Mr. Gladstone
made a long and eloquent speech, in the course of
which—after thanking the deputation for their
token of sympathy and their grateful references to
himself—he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Mr. Stevenson—I address myself now perhaps
more particularly to you and to my own countrymen,
to any of them who will take notice of the
deputation. I have said that in my opinion this
manifestation from the Armenian community in
England and in Paris was, on my part at least, quite
undeserved. I have done nothing for you in circumstances
of great difficulty, and that, let me assure
you, has not been owing to indifference. I will explain
the cause in very few words. Rumors went abroad,
growing more and more authenticated, which represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>a state of horrible and indescribable outrage
in Armenia. The impulse of every man in circumstances
of that kind is to give way to a burst of
strong feeling, but I had the conviction that in a
grave case of this kind every nation is best and most
properly represented by its government, which is the
organ of the nation, and which has the right to speak
with the authority of the nation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do not let me be told that one nation has no
authority over another. Every nation, and if need be
every human being, has authority on behalf of humanity
and of justice. (Hear, hear.) These are principles
common to mankind, and the violation of which
may justly, at the proper time, open the mouths of the
very humblest among us. But in such cases as these
we must endeavor to do injustice to no one, and the
more dreadful the allegations may be, the more
strictly it is our duty not to be premature in assuming
their truth, but to wait for an examination of the
case, and to see that what we say, we say upon a
basis of ascertained facts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, gentlemen, it was, my fate—my fortune,
I think—about eighteen years ago to take an active
part with regard to other outrages which first
came up in the shape of rumor, but were afterwards
too horribly verified, in Bulgaria; but I never
stirred in regard to those outrages until in the
first place, their existence and their character had
been established by indisputable authority; and,
secondly, until I had found myself driven to absolute
despair in regard to any hopes that I could entertain
of a proper representation of British feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>on the part of the government which was then in
office. You will see, therefore, that my conduct
on this occasion has not been inconsistent with what
I then did (hear, hear), and it does not imply, old as
I am, that my feelings have been deadened in regard
to matters of such a dreadful description. (Cheers.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I remained silent because I had full confidence
that the government of the Queen would do its
duty, and I still entertain that confidence. Its power
and influence are considerable; at the same time they
are limited. It is not in the power of this country,
acting singly, to undertake to represent humanity at
large, and to inflict, even upon the grossest wrongdoers,
the punishments that their crimes may have
deserved; but there is such a thing as the conscience
of mankind at large, and the conscience is not limited
even to Christendom. (Hear, hear.) And there
is a great power in the collected voice of outraged
humanity. What happened in Bulgaria? The Sultan
and his government absolutely denied that anything
wrong had been done. Yes, but their denial
was shattered by the force of facts. The truth was
exhibited to the world. It was thought an extravagance
at the time when I said: ‘It is time that
the Turk and all his belongings should go out of
Bulgaria bag and baggage.’ They did go out of
Bulgaria, and they went out of a good deal besides.
But, quite independent of any sentiment of right,
justice, or humanity, common sense and common
prudence ought to have taught them not to repeat
the infernal acts which disgraced the year 1876, so
far as Turkey was concerned. (Cheers.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Now, it is certainly true that we have not arrived
at the close of this inquiry, and I will say nothing to
assume that the allegations will be verified. At the
same time I cannot pretend to say that there is no
reason to anticipate an unfavorable issue. On the contrary,
the intelligence which has reached me tends to a
conclusion which I still hope may not be verified,
but tends strongly to a conclusion to the general
effect that the outrages and the scenes and abominations
of 1876 in Bulgaria have been repeated in 1894
in Armenia. As I have said, I hope it is not so, and
I will hope to the last, but if it is so it is time that
one general shout of execration, not of men, but of
deeds, one general shout of execration directed
against deeds of wickedness, should rise from outraged
humanity, and should force itself into the ears
of the Sultan of Turkey and make him sensible, if
anything can make him sensible, of the madness of
such a course.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The history of Turkey has been a sad and
painful history. That race has not been without
remarkable and even in some cases fine qualities,
but from too many points of view it has been
a scourge to the world, made use of, no doubt,
by a wise Providence for the sins of the world. If
these tales of murder, violation, and outrage be true,
then it will follow that they cannot be overlooked,
and they cannot be made light of. I have lived to
see the Empire of Turkey in Europe reduced to less
than one half of what it was when I was born, and
why? Simply because of its misdeeds—a great record
written by the hand of Almighty God, in whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Turk, as a Mohammedan, believes, and believes firmly—written
by the hand of Almighty God against injustice,
against lust, against the most abominable
cruelty; and if—and I hope, and I feel sure, that the
government of the Queen will do everything that
can be done to pierce to the bottom of this mystery,
and to make the facts known to the world—if, happily—I
speak hoping against hope—if the reports we have
read are to be disproved or to be mitigated, then let
us thank God; but if, on the other hand, they be
established, then I say it will more than ever stand
before the world that there is no lesson, however
severe, that can teach certain people the duty, the
prudence, the necessity of observing in some degree
the laws of decency, and of humanity, and of
justice, and that if allegations such as these are
established, it will stand as if it were written with
letters of iron on the records of the world, that such
a government as that which can countenance and
cover the perpetration of such outrages is a disgrace
in the first place to Mahomet, the Prophet whom it
professes to follow, that it is a disgrace to civilization
at large, and that it is a curse to mankind. (Cheers.)
Now, that is strong language.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Strong language ought to be used when facts are
strong, and ought not to be used without strength of
facts. I have counselled you still to retain and to keep
your judgment in suspense, but as the evidence grows
and the case darkens, my hopes dwindle and decline;
and as long as I have a voice I hope that voice, upon
occasions, will be uttered on behalf of humanity and
truth.” (Cheers.)<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>In a remarkable paper entitled <cite>Bulgarian Horrors
and the Question of the East</cite> called forth by the atrocities
in 1876, Mr. Gladstone sums up some of the
qualities of the Turkish race and of Turkish rule as
follows:<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me endeavor very briefly to sketch, in the
rudest outline, what the Turkish race was and what
it is. It is not a question of Mohammedanism simply,
but of Mohammedanism compounded with the
peculiar character of a race. They are not the mild
Mohammedans of India, nor the chivalrous Saladins
of Syria, nor the cultured Moors of Spain. They
were, upon the whole, from the black day when they
first entered Europe, the one great anti-human specimen
of humanity. Wherever they went, a broad
line of blood marked the track behind them; and, as
far as their dominion reached, civilization disappeared
from view. They represented everywhere
government by force as opposed to government by
law. For the guide of this life they had a relentless
fatalism; for its reward hereafter, a sensual paradise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were, indeed, a tremendous incarnation of
military power. This advancing curse menaced the
whole of Europe. It was only stayed—and that not
in one generation, but in many—by the heroism of
the European population of those very countries
part of which form at this moment the scene of war,
and the anxious subject of diplomatic action. In
the olden time all Western Christendom sympathized
with the resistance to the common enemy; and even
during the hot and fierce struggles of the Reformation there were prayers, if I mistake not, offered up
in the English churches for the success of the
emperor—the head of the Roman Catholic power
and influence—in his struggles with the Turk.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“But, although the Turk represented force as opposed
to law, yet not even a government of force
can be maintained without the aid of an intellectual
element such as he did not possess. Hence there
grew up what has been rare in the history of the
world, a kind of tolerance in the midst of cruelty,
tyranny, and rapine. Much of Christian life was
contemptuously let alone, much of the subordinate
functions of government was allowed to devolve
upon the bishops; and a race of Greeks was attracted
to Constantinople which has all along made up, in
some degree, the deficiencies of Turkish Islam in the
element of mind, and which at this moment provides
the Porte with its long-known and, I must add,
highly esteemed ambassador in London. Then
there have been, from time to time, but rarely,
statesmen whom we have been too ready to mistake
for specimens of what Turkey might become, whereas
they were, in truth, more like <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusus naturæ</span></i>, on
the favorable side,—monsters, so to speak, of virtue
or intelligence. And there were (and are) also,
scattered through the community, men who were
not, indeed, real citizens, but yet who have exhibited
the true civic virtues, and who would have been
citizens, had there been a true polity around them.
Besides all this, the conduct of the race has gradually
been brought more under the eye of Europe, which
it has lost its power to resist or to defy; and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>central government, in conforming perforce to many
of the forms and traditions of civilization, has occasionally
caught something of their spirit....</p>

<p class='c011'>“I entreat my countrymen, upon whom far more
than perhaps any other people of Europe it depends,
to require and to insist that our government, which
has been working in one direction, shall work in the
other, and shall apply all its vigor to concur with the
other states of Europe in obtaining the extinction
of the Turkish executive power in Bulgaria. Let
the Turks now carry away their abuses in the only
possible manner—namely, by carrying off themselves.
Their Zaptiehs and their Mudirs, their Bimbashis
and their Yuzbachis, their Kaimakams and their
Pashas,—one and all, bag and baggage,—shall, I
hope, clear out from the province they have desolated
and profaned. This thorough riddance, this most
blessed deliverance, is the only reparation we can
make to the memory of those heaps on heaps of
dead; to the violated purity alike of matron, of
maiden, and of child; to the civilization which has
been affronted and shamed; to the laws of God, or,
if you like, of Allah; to the moral sense of mankind
at large. There is not a criminal in a European jail,
there is not a cannibal in the South Sea Islands,
whose indignation would not arise and overboil at
the recital of that which has been done; which has
too late been examined, but which remains unavenged;
which has left behind all the foul and all
the fierce passions that produced it; and which may
again spring up, in another murderous harvest, from
the soil soaked and reeking with blood, and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>air tainted with every imaginable deed of crime and
shame. <em>That such things should be done once is a
damning disgrace to the portion of our race which
did them, that a door should be left open for their
ever-so-barely possible repetition would spread that
shame over the whole.</em><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Better, we may justly tell the

an example of the fiendish misuse of the
powers established by God ‘for the punishment of
evil-doers, and for the encouragement of them that
do well.’ No government ever has so sinned; none
has so proved itself incorrigible in sin, or, which is
the same, so impotent for reformation. If it be allowable
that the executive power of Turkey should
renew, at this great crisis, by permission or authority
of Europe, the charter of its existence in Bulgaria,
then there is not on record, since the beginnings of
political society, a protest that man has lodged
against intolerable misgovernment, or a stroke he has
dealt at loathsome tyranny, that ought not henceforth
forward to be branded as a crime.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>That a field so rich in possibilities for the student
of history, ethnology, or language as Armenia
and Kurdistan should have remained as yet so
little explored, is due, no doubt, to three causes<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a>:
first, the apparent loss of significance of the Armenian
nation, which now, like Poland, seems but a stranded
wreck in the stream of history; second, to her geographical
isolation and the danger and hardship of
travel in that region<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a>; third, to the linguistic
obstacles to be overcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>So little clear and accurate information about the
Armenians is readily accessible that the following
brief outline is offered in the hope of meeting this
want at the present time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>History</span>—The Armenian race belongs to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Japhetic branch of the human family, falling under the
same category as the inhabitants of India and Persia,
who form the Aryans of Asia. The Armenian
language proves this by its affinity with the Indo-Germanic
tongues. Their physiognomy and physical
constitution connect them with the best types of
Caucasian stock. Their manners and customs, as
well as their religious beliefs, in heathenism, were
similar to those of the Assyrians and Chaldeans, of
the Medes and Persians, and, still later, of the Parthians.</p>

<p class='c011'>These people call themselves Haik, after Haig, the
most celebrated of their ancient kings, and their
land Haiasdan. Their national legends, fortified in
their eyes by the Bible, make Haig descend from
Ashkenaz or Togarmah, children of Gomer, a patriarch
of the line of Japhet.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Foreigners applied to
them the name Armenians, derived from King Aram,
said to be a descendant of Haig, who made great
conquests.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest biblical mention of this land is the
statement that the ark “rested upon the mountains
of Ararat,” a term which evidently refers to a district
rather than a peak.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Another scriptural allusion
is in connection with Sennacherib, whose parricidal
sons are said to have escaped, 681 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, “into the
land of Armenia.”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Ezekiel also refers to Armenia
under the name Togarmah, as furnishing Tyre with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>horses and mules, a product for which it is still
noted.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Tigranes I. is said to have been an ally of
Cyrus the Great in overthrowing the Babylonians,
and thus in liberating the Jews after their seventy
years’ captivity, 538 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> A foreshadowing of this
event is probably found in the prophet Jeremiah:
“Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat,
Minni, and Ashkenaz,&nbsp;... to make the land of
Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the famous inscriptions of the Achemenidæ, at
Persepolis and at Behistun, the name Armenia is
found in various forms, and the Armenian tributaries
march after the Cappadocians to render homage to
the great king.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Herodotus mentions the absorption of the Armenian
Empire in that of Darius, 514 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, and a
tribute of four hundred talents exacted.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Xenophon’s account of the retreat of the ten
thousand through this mountainous region, in midwinter,
and constantly harassed by enemies, is valuable,
not only as a tribute to the splendid discipline
and spirit of the Greeks, but for the light which it
throws upon the ancient Armenians and Kurds,
whose houses, domestic habits, and employments are
the same in many respects even at the present day.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Armenia was included in the conquests of Alexander,
and afterwards submitted to the Seleucidæ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Syria. In 190 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, when Antiochus the Great was
defeated by Scipio, Armenia revolted under Artaxias,
who gave refuge to the exiled Hannibal. About
150 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span>, the great Parthian king, Mithridates I.,
established his brother Valarsaces in Armenia. The
most celebrated king of this branch of the Arsacid
family was Tigranes II., who, while aiding Mithridates
of Pontus, was defeated by Pompey. After
this, Tacitus says that the Armenians were almost
always at war; with the Romans through hatred,
and with the Parthians through jealousy.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Princes
of this line continued to rule, however, until the
Arsacidæ were driven from the Persian throne by
the Sassanid Ardashir. Though frequently conquered
by the kings of that dynasty, Armenia was
enabled as often to re-assert her freedom by the help
of Roman arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Tiridates embraced Christianity, 276 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>,
the struggle became embittered by the introduction
of a religious element, for the Persians were bigoted
Zoroastrians. This condition reached a climax when
the country was divided between the Romans and
Persians, under Theodosius the Great, 390 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>After the fall of the Sassanidæ, in the seventh century,
Armenia was divided between the Greek Empire
and the Saracens; but from 859 to 1045 it was
again ruled by a native dynasty of vigorous princes,
the Pagratidæ. This was brought to a close by the
suspicious and short-sighted policy of the Byzantine
emperors, one of whom, Constantine IX., at last
overthrew the Armenian kingdom, thereby laying
open the whole eastern frontier to the invasion of
the Seljouk Turks, who shortly before had begun
their attacks, and who might have been successfully
resisted by these hardy mountaineers. The result
was fatal, both to Armenia, which was overrun, and
to the Greek Empire; for by the battle of Manzikert,
1071 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>, when Romanus IV. was defeated and
made prisoner by Alp Arslan, the whole of Asia
Minor was left at the mercy of the Seljouks.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Rupen, a relative of the last Pagratid sovereign,
escaped into Cilicia, and established the Rupenian
dynasty, which was not extinguished until the
death of Leon VI., 1393, an exile in Paris, and the
last of the Armenian kings. The Rupenians had
entered into alliance with the Crusaders. They welcomed
the Mongolian hordes under Genghis Khan,
early in the thirteenth century, and suffered the
vengeance of the Mamelukes, 1375.</p>

<p class='c011'>A graphic account of the cruelties of Timour the
Tartar, who devastated Armenia at the close of the
fourteenth century, has been left us by Thomas of
Medzop. The last great calamity which fell upon
the mother country happened in 1605, when Shah
Abbas forcibly transplanted twelve thousand families
to Ispahan in Persia.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Armenian Church.</span>—It is the oldest of all
national churches. Their legends claim that our Lord
corresponded with King Abgarus of Edessa or Ur,
and that the apostles Thaddæus and Bartholomew
preached the Gospel to them. But the historical
founder of the Armenian church was St. Gregory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“The Illuminator,”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a> an Arsacid prince, related to
King Tiridates (Dertad), who was consecrated Bishop
of Armenia, at Cæsarea, in 302 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> The Armenian
church is Episcopal in polity, and closely resembles
the Greek in outward forms.</p>

<p class='c011'>Misled by imperfect reports of the Council of
Chalcedon, 451, which they were not able to attend
on account of Persian persecutions, the Armenian
bishops annulled its decrees in 536, thus gaining the
credit of being Eutychians, which led to their gradual
separation from the orthodox church, much to the
satisfaction of the Persian ruler Chosroes. This estrangement
was doubtless political as much as doctrinal,
on account of the attempts at ecclesiastical
supremacy by the churches of Constantinople and
Rome. As far as her ecclesiastical writers are concerned,
and her beautiful liturgy, the Armenian
church is in general orthodox. Her heresy, in common
with that of the rest of Christendom, is one of
life rather than of doctrine. A schism in the Armenian
church was brought about in the sixteenth century
by Jesuit missionaries, who succeeded in detaching
the community of Catholic Armenians from the
mother church, of which the Catholicos at Etchmiadzin
is recognized as the supreme head.</p>

<p class='c011'>All Armenians—except perhaps the Catholic,
whose allegiance has been transferred of course to
Rome—still cherish a passionate attachment for the
venerable church of their ancestors, to which they
owe their identity as a people after the terrible vicissitudes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of so many centuries. It is true that Armenians
who have come under European influence,
especially French, have to some extent become sceptical
and indifferent to religion. But even such men
still profess at least an outward loyalty, as a matter
of sentiment, and because they believe the formal
preservation of the Armenian church to be the condition
of national union in the future as it has been
in the past. It is, indeed, almost a political necessity,
as the Ottoman Empire is now constituted.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be hoped that the time will come when the
children of the Armenian church of every shade will
no longer look upon her as a mother frail and failing,
yet to be treated with respect while she lasts; nor as
a mother ignorant and bigoted beyond hope of reform;
still less, as one heretical and to be abandoned
for Rome. Rather, let all her sons rally around her
and help her to fulfil her true spiritual mission. She
will then renew her youth and again take her honored
place in the front ranks of “the Church of the living
God, which is the pillar and ground of the truth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Would that the spirit of the grand and broadminded
man who is now the Catholicos at Etchmiadzin,
His Holiness, Mugerditch Khrimian, might
pervade the whole body of which he is the honored
and beloved head. Less than a year ago, the author
had the privilege of a long private interview with this
venerable ecclesiastic, whose hand he kissed in oriental
fashion, with respect for the man and for himself.
His last words to me, found upon the title-page,
were “<em>Husahadelu chenk</em>,” meaning, “We must not
despair”—a good motto for us all.</p>

<p>THE CATHOLICOS OF ETCHMIADZIN, IN THE CAUCASUS.<br /><br />Religious head of the Armenian Church.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>That the grand old church of “The Illuminator”
should somewhat lose its hold on the mind and conscience
of the rising generation at this stage of superficial
enlightenment is not strange. Her real merits
are concealed, unfortunately, under a growth of superstition
and ignorance which even the clergy admit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>but lack the courage and ability to remove. These
abuses, however, are not due to any demoralization
of the Armenian race itself, but to its isolation, and
to the repeated and terrible devastations that have
checked its growth and reduced it to a condition of
extreme poverty and helplessness.</p>

<p class='c011'>No greater service could be rendered to the Armenian
people than aid and encouragement in establishing
institutions for the education of the clergy,
who under present circumstances are their natural
leaders. The twentieth century will bring, we hope,
better political privileges. But unless, in the meantime,
the ancient church has maintained her hold
on the conscience of the rising generation, she is in
danger of sinking into the position of the church in
France.</p>

<p class='c011'>By nature the Armenians are deeply religious, as
their whole literature and history show. It has been
a religion of the heart, not of the head. Its evidence
is not to be found in metaphysical discussions and
hair-splitting theology as in the case of the Greeks,
but in a brave and simple record written with the
tears of saints and illuminated with the blood of
martyrs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The seeds of a thorough and far-reaching reformation
have been carefully sown and are already bearing
fruit. The prospect of reform is brightened by
three facts: first, the Armenian church is essentially
democratic, and is not in bondage to any “infallible”
human authority; second, her errors of doctrine and
practice are not fundamental, and, having never been
sanctioned by councils, but simply by custom and
tradition, can in due time be discarded; third, she
has always acknowledged the supreme authority of
the Bible, which is no longer a sealed book, having
been translated into the modern tongue by American
missionaries, very widely scattered, and at last gladly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>received by all classes. The demand for progress and
reform is by no means confined to the so-called
“evangelical” element, but is making itself heard
even in the pulpits of the old church and in the
secular press.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Armenians, very numerous in ancient times,
now number only about 4,000,000, of whom 2,500,000
are under the Sultan, 1,200,000 in Russia, 150,000 in
Persia, and the rest widely scattered in many lands,
but everywhere distinguished for their peaceable and
enterprising character. They are the leading bankers,
merchants, and skilled artisans of Turkey, and extensively
engage in the various trades, manufactures,
and agriculture as well. They love their native home
and are yet destined to play an important part in the
moral and material regeneration of western Asia.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following estimate is from an experienced and
discriminating authority, who is also a member of
the Church of England:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have confessed already to a prejudice against
the Armenians, but it is not possible to deny that
they are the most capable, energetic, enterprising,
and pushing race in Western Asia, physically superior,
and intellectually acute, and <em>above all they
are a race which can be raised in all respects to our
own level, neither religion, color, customs, nor inferiority
in intellect or force constituting any barrier between
us</em>. Their shrewdness and aptitude for business
are remarkable, and whatever exists of commercial
enterprise in Eastern Asia Minor is almost altogether
in their hands. They have singular elasticity, as
their survival as a church and nation shows, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>cannot but think it likely that they may have some
share in determining the course of events in the
East, both politically and religiously. As Orientals
they understand Oriental character and modes of
thought as we never can, and if a new Pentecostal
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">afflatus</span></i> were to fall upon the educated and intelligent
young men who are being trained in the colleges
which the American churches have scattered liberally
through Asia Minor, the effect upon Turkey would
be marvellous. I think most decidedly that reform
in Turkey must come through Christianity,
and in this view the reform and enlightenment of the
religion which has such a task before it are of momentous
importance.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Language and Literature.</span>—The Armenian
grammar is analogous to that of other languages of
the same origin. It has not the distinction of gender,
but is rich in its declensions and conjugations.
The accent of Armenian words is on the last syllable,
and many of the strong consonantal sounds
strike the ear of a foreigner with harshness, and defy
his tongue. The rich native vocabulary has been
increased by additions from languages with which it
has come in contact. It possesses also, as the German,
great facility in building compound words.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest specimen of this language, though in
the cuneiform character, is probably to be found in
the tri-lingual inscriptions on the great citadel rock
of Van, which have not yet been satisfactorily made
out. The pre-Christian literature of Armenia, consisting
of national songs, has entirely perished, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>a few quotations. All that has come down to
us is subsequent to the fourth century, and refers
exclusively to history or religion. Poetry and fiction
never greatly flourished among this serious race, always
in the midst of danger or suffering.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ancient Armenian version of the Bible, made
by Mesrob, the inventor of their alphabet, and his
disciples, early in the fifth century, has been called
the queen of versions for its beauty, and, though not
based on the Hebrew, is of some critical value in
determining the readings of the Septuagint, of which
it does not follow any known recension. Hundreds
of other translations from Syriac and Greek writers
soon followed, some of which are extant only in
Armenian.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fifth century, their Golden Age, was adorned
by such classic writers as Yeznig of Goghp, who
wrote most eloquently, in four books, against the
Persian fire-worshippers, the Greek philosophers,
the Marcion heresy, and the Manichæans; Goriun,
the biographer of Mesrob; David, the philosopher
and translator of Aristotle; Yeghishe, who relates
the heroic struggle of Vartan for the Christian faith
against the Persian Zoroastrians; Lazarus of Parb;
and Moses of Khorene, their national historian.
There follows a period of four centuries of literary
barrenness, due to political disorder and schism.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the Rupenian dynasty there was a second
period of literary brilliancy. Then flourished Nerses
Schnorhali “The Gracious,” an orator grafted upon
the poet; as well as Nerses of Lampron, whose hymns
also enrich the beautiful Armenian liturgy. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>annals of Matthew of Edessa give interesting facts
about the first Crusade. Samuel of Ani, John
Vanagan, Vartan the Great, and Thomas of Medzop
wrote succeeding chronicles.</p>

<p class='c011'>A third revival of Armenian letters was begun by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Mechitar of Sebaste (Sivas), who established an order
of Catholic monks at the monastery of St. Lazarus
in Venice, 1717. These fathers have won the interest
and admiration of European scholars by their
publication of Armenian classics, together with many
learned original contributions. Other centres of
literary activity are to be found in Vienna, Paris,
and the Institute of Moscow, as well as the schools
of Constantinople and Tiflis.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The American missionaries in the Turkish Empire
are brought into the discussion of almost
every question that arises in that land.
Especially is this true at present, in connection with
the Armenian problem. So many wild and contradictory
statements are made in regard to them, and
the Protestant communities which are the direct results
of their labors, that the mind of the public is
more or less confused on the subject. The missionaries,
and the many thousands who have gladly followed
their leadership in intellectual, moral, and
religious reform, <em>are</em> an important, though not a
noisy or conspicuous element. For this reason, as
well as on account of popular ignorance and hostile
misrepresentation, they cannot be overlooked in any
fair and adequate survey of the situation. The
writer has long been familiar with this phase of the
subject, and has a large mass of evidence and statistics
at his command. <em>But he is not connected with
any of the various missionary societies involved, and is
alone responsible for the statements made in this or
any other part of the volume.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>It is very important to note that charges against
the missionaries, of disloyalty to the Sultan, have
never been sustained for a moment, and that investigation
has shown them to be obedient to the laws,
and opposed to revolutionary sentiments upon the
part of any of the subjects of the Empire. The
highest officials have repeatedly borne public testimony
to the valuable services of the Americans in
educational, literary, medical and philanthropic
lines. Even H. I. M. Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid has
graciously given expression to his confidence in
Americans as being free from any political designs,
such as all Europeans are supposed to entertain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many are not aware of the great work already accomplished
by American missionaries during the
past seventy years in the Ottoman Empire, nor of
the vast influence they have exerted, both directly
and indirectly. They have been in many departments
the pioneers of civilization. They have stuck
to their posts, obscure or prominent, in peace or in
war, in famine, plague and persecution. Pashas and
diplomats and generals have sought their aid without
fear of being misled or betrayed. But the messengers
of the Cross have never been swerved from what
they consider a “higher calling”—to instruct the
ignorant, young and old, to counsel and reclaim the
erring, to attend the sick and imprisoned, and to
comfort the broken-hearted. To support these general
statements, the reader must pardon a few statistics
compiled from the latest official tables, showing
the <em>direct results</em> of American missionary effort in
Turkey.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even these large figures by no means measure the
extent and significance of Protestant influence in
Turkey. The idea and spirit of Protestantism has a
breadth which cannot be measured or portrayed by
figures. As a matter of convenience and political
necessity, and also to destroy unity of feeling and
action among the subject peoples, all non-Moslem
races were classified by Mohammed II., after the
capture of Constantinople in 1453, according to their
religious belief. These lines of division have always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>been strictly observed by the government in all its
dealings with non-Moslems. Even many of the taxes
are collected through ecclesiastical organizations.
This policy of the government, together with the
bitter persecution of Protestants by the older
churches, led to the formation of a Protestant civil
community in 1850, contrary to the original desire
and instruction of the missionaries, and in spite of
the protests of many evangelicals who preferred to
retain connection with their ancestral church, but
who were thrust out with violence and anathema.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Protestant communities which then sprang up
all over the Empire, were not ruled, as are the other
Oriental churches, by hierarchical bodies. The missionaries,
who are mostly Congregational or Presbyterian,
while ready to advise and guide, have never
exercised ecclesiastical control over their converts.
The Protestants, in accordance with their inherent
spirit and beliefs, have naturally organized their religious
and civil communities on a simple representative
basis, which has gradually developed independence
of thought and character, and desire for
progress.</p>

<p class='c011'>We come now to the <em>indirect results</em> of missionary
effort, namely, the stimulus of evangelical example and
success upon the Gregorian and other communities
including even the Mohammedans. The homes,
schools, and churches of the missionaries have been
open to all comers; their varied literature has gone
everywhere; their aid in sickness, distress, and
famine has always ignored race or creed. Many
thousands of Armenians, Greeks, Syrians, Jacobites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>and others—Moslems being prevented by
their rulers except in rare instances—have received
education in Protestant schools, without changing
their church relations. But, nevertheless, a deep
impression has been made on these pupils by contact
no less than by teaching, and this, together with
a natural and worthy loyalty to their own institutions,
has stirred up all the other races to higher ideals and
efforts.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The existence of a marked desire for progress by
all classes is now clear, and that this is largely due to
foreign missionaries is admitted by all<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a>—gratefully
by the Armenians and Christians generally, but often
with chagrin by the Turks, who find themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>being rapidly left behind in the forward march which
they have been too stupid or too proud to fall in
with. It is, however, very gratifying to see that the
Mohammedan leaders in both Church and State are
at length becoming aware of the marked intellectual
awakening and substantial progress that education
has quietly brought about among the Christian races.
Robert College on the Bosphorus stands at the head
of the many well equipped American institutions in
Turkey which have largely contributed to these
results.</p>

<p class='c011'>We gladly recognize the wisdom and energy of
His Majesty the present Sultan, in trying to establish
Moslem schools throughout his empire, some of
which are already quite large, creditable, and popular
with the Turks. It cannot be doubted that these
schools will lead ultimately to an awakening and a
desire for reform and progress among Moslems
which will make them no less restive under present
conditions than are the non-Moslems to-day, and
thus hasten the necessary reforms. While most
hearty praise is due His Majesty for fostering and
even forcing education among his Moslem subjects,
it is greatly to be regretted that there is another side
to this policy as carried out by his agents, namely,
an equal zeal in curtailing and even closing, as far as
possible, Christian schools.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hostility of the Sublime Porte has been growing,
just in proportion as the excellent results of
American institutions, already enumerated, have
appeared. Does the Turkish Government desire
that its hostility be considered the most convincing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>proof of the success of disinterested efforts to benefit
its subjects of all classes? And does it propose
to continue to cripple and suppress such efforts? If
so, it is not the two hundred and fifty American
missionaries in her borders who will suffer, but the
many schools and churches which they have planted
and the many thousands of peaceable and hitherto
loyal subjects, who have been taught in them to
serve God as well as honor the king.</p>

      <div class='line in4'><em>Constantinople, January 24, 1884</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The legation of the United States of America has the honor to invite
the attention of his highness, the minister of foreign affairs, to
the matters following:</p>

<p class='c011'>By note No. 167, June 13, 1883, the legation informed his highness
that two American citizens, traveling in the vilayet of Bitlis, had
been set upon by Kurds, robbed, and left to die, and that the
governor-general of the vilayet had manifested the most singular indifference
about the affair, and might be fairly charged with responsibility
for the escape of the malefactors. The suggestion was then
made that his highness would serve the cause of humanity and justice
by ordering the most energetic measures to be taken for the apprehension
of the robbers.</p>

<p class='c011'>By a communication, No. 71235, June 13, 1883, his highness was
good enough to answer the note of the legation, and give the pleasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>intelligence that the governor-general had succeeded in discovering
the goods taken from the two gentlemen, and that the robbers
had been arrested and delivered up to justice. This information his
highness reported as derived from the governor-general.</p>

<p class='c011'>This report the legation found it necessary to correct; and for that
purpose it addressed a second note to his highness, the minister of
foreign affairs, No. 179, dated September 10, 1883, declaring that the
robbers had not been arrested, and that the goods and money taken
from Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds had been returned to them, but in
small parts. Under impression that it was yet possible to obtain the
powerful assistance of the Sublime Porte in bringing the thieves and
assassins to justice, the legation in the same note proceeded to give
the full particulars of the affair, both those connected with the assault
and those descriptive of the action of the governor-general. Of
the assault, it remarked that Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, accepting
the assurance of the governor-general that the roads were perfectly
safe, set out on their journey without a guard of zaptiehs. They put
up for a night at a house where there was present Moussa Bey, son
of Meza Bey, an influential Kurdish chief. When they took their
coffee they failed to send a cup of it to the said Moussa, who feeling
himself insulted by the inattention, took four assistants and next day
waylaid the gentlemen, one of whom, Mr. Knapp, they beat with
clubs until they supposed him dead. Moussa Bey, with his own
hand, cut down Dr. Reynolds, giving him ten cuts with a sword.
The two were then bound and dragged into the bushes and there left
to die. That there might be no excuse, such as that the murderers
were unknown, the legation gave his highness the names of the subordinate
assassins and their places of abode, Sherif Oglon Osman
and Iskan Oglon Hassan, both of the village of Movnok. A third
one was pointed out as the servant of Moussa Bey, living in the village
of Kabiaa. Of the action of the governor-general the legation
said further that when the affair was reported to him he made a show
of action by sending zaptiehs to arrest the robbers, but, singular to
remark, he selected Meza Bey, the father of Moussa, to take charge
of the party. Going to the village of Auzont, Meza Bey pointed out
four Kurds of another tribe as the guilty men, took them into custody
and carried them for identification to Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds,
who said they were not the assailants.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the night, in Aozou, a bundle was thrown through a window
into a room occupied by the police, which on examination proved to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>contain a portion of the stolen goods. With this the governor-general
rested from his efforts and dispatched to his highness the minister
of foreign affairs, that the stolen goods were recovered and
returned, and the felons captured and punished. This report, the
legation took the liberty of informing his highness, was not true, also
that the chief of the assassins, Moussa Bey, was still at large; and
to emphasize its statement, the legation further said to his highness,
that the details it communicated were current through all the region
of Bitlis, having been first given out by Moussa himself. The legation
then, in the same note, exposed the maladministration of the
governor-general in language plain as respect for his highness, the
minister, and for the Sublime Porte would permit, and suggested as
the only means of accomplishing anything like redress that a brave
impartial officer be sent to Bitlis to investigate the conduct of the
governor and take the affair in his own hands. “Such a step,” it
was added, “might serve to save the lives of many Christians,” and
it was further represented that “could the assassins be brought to
just sentence it would unquestionably lessen the demand for indemnity
which otherwise it would be the duty of the legation to present
against the Imperial Government in this connection.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On November 7, 1883, the legation of the United States, by a third
note, No. 184, communicated to his highness, the minister of foreign
affairs, that the governor-general of Bitlis had confronted four persons
with Mr. Knapp for identification, and that that gentleman had
recognized Moussa Bey as one of those who had robbed and wounded
him. The legation of the United States then expressed a hope that
the minister of foreign affairs would give proper orders for bringing
Moussa Bey and his companions in crime before the tribunals for
trial.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still later, on November 12, 1883, the legation of the United
States addressed a fourth note, No. 185, to his highness, the minister
of foreign affairs, detailing again the circumstances of the attempted
murder of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, and representing the untrustworthiness
of the governor-general by charging that Moussa Bey
had already obtained from him assurances of immunity in the event
of a trial and conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>His highness, the minister, was then requested that, if it was
decided to maintain the governor-general at his post, orders be given
for the transfer of the criminals to Constantinople for trial.</p>

<p class='c011'>The three notes last named of the legation of the United States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>have not been answered by his highness, the minister of foreign
affairs, except in a note, dated December 8, 1883, in which he is
pleased to renew assurances based upon telegrams from the governor-general,
which are utterly unreliable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wherefore, abandoning hope of justice through the governor-general
of Bitlis, and the judicial tribunals of the empire, the legation
of the United States finds itself compelled to change its form of application
for redress, and demand of the Sublime Porte indemnity in
behalf of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, for the former £1,500, and
for the latter, because of the more serious nature of his injuries,
£2,000.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your No. 317, of the
25th ultimo, relative to the case of the Rev. Mr. Knapp and Dr.
Reynolds, murderously attacked by Kurds near Bitlis, and to say
that, after a careful consideration of all the facts before the Department,
the inaction of the governor of Bitlis and the failure of the
supreme Government to force him to undertake such measures as the
case evidently demanded, must be regarded as a denial of justice.
While this Government is always averse to making money demands
for indemnity in countries whose administration of justice may differ
from our own, the Department feels compelled to resort to this
remedy under circumstances which manifestly make the local officers
and the Government of the Porte responsible for the failure to do
justice in this case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The action reported in your dispatch is, consequently, approved.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THE POSITION TAKEN IN CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>General Lew Wallace is understood to have been emphatically
a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">persona grata</span></i> as U. S. Minister to Turkey, in fact to have enjoyed,
to a very exceptional degree, the personal confidence and
friendship of His Majesty the present Sultan. The following quotation
will show what treatment even he received in the discharge of
his official duties in the case under consideration:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>From the Regular Correspondent of the Tribune.</em></div>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Constantinople</span>, March 1, 1884.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Porte, in deciding how far it is safe to affront foreign Governments,
has even ranked the United States below some of the
European States. The Porte during the past year has treated General
Wallace as if he were the representative of a Danubian Principality.
Remonstrance after remonstrance against fresh violations of
the treaties it has left unanswered, and it has repeatedly omitted the
courtesy of a bare acknowledgment of their receipt. In fact, Turkey
has been relying upon the distance of the United States. Perhaps its
officials even suppose that the American navy is afraid to risk adventures
so far from home as the coasts of the Levant.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Wallace found it necessary, for the sake of the safety of
American citizens in Turkey, to press for some definition of the situation.
During nearly five weeks he had been refused a personal
interview with the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the ground of
“indisposition.” During all that time the representative of that Minister
declined to enter upon any discussion of the important questions
at issue. Four times the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United
States had been turned away from the door of the Sublime Porte by
the refusal of the Grand Vizier to see him. Each time plausible
reasons were assigned which seemed to render any insistance on the
part of the General uncourteous. Yet it became daily more evident
that all these plausible excuses for declining negotiation on the injuries
done by Turkey to American commerce and to American citizens
were part of a settled purpose not to redress the wrongs.—<cite>New York
Semi-Weekly Tribune</cite>, March 28, 1884.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h3 class='c018'>THE RESULT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The ten years that have elapsed since the above was written clearly
show that what seemed then to be a “settled purpose” has become
the settled policy of the Ottoman Government in regard to Americans
and their rights in Turkey.</p>

<p class='c011'>In regard to the outcome of the case of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds,
the humiliating fact must be recorded that not one cent of the
indemnity demanded by the United States of America has to this day
been obtained. The monster, Moussa Bey, was allowed by the
Turkish Government to continue his outrages on the Armenian villages
of the great Moosh plain, until his record became so appalling,
that under European pressure the Porte summoned him to Constantinople,
where he was entertained as the Sultan’s guest. He was
whitewashed by the courts, but the Sultan was prevailed upon to
invite him to make a pilgrimage to Medina at his expense, and there
spend the remainder of his days in religious exercises.</p>

<p class='c031'>The following petition was recently presented to the Hon. Walter
Q. Gresham, Secretary of State, and to the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of America, for the establishment
of U. S. Consulates at Erzerum and Harpoot. The necessary
legislation has been promptly enacted, for which the thanks of all
Americans in Turkey is due to His Excellency the President, to the
Secretary of State and to members of both Houses of Congress.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Apropos to the recent massacre of five thousand Armenians in
Turkey, it is clearly inexpedient for the United States to mix up in
the Eastern Question. But it is equally clear that <em>the duty of protecting
a large body of native-born American citizens constantly subjected
to danger, injury and insult in that land is not complicated by
any Monroe Doctrine</em>. In their interests, attention is called to this
brief statement of facts, and to a practical request for consular protection.</p>

<h3 class='c032'>1. <span class='sc'>Number of Individuals and Interests Involved.</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Distributed in thirty of the principal cities of Asiatic Turkey alone,
there is a permanent body of <em>two hundred and fifty Americans</em>, not
including their children, who hold <em>over two million dollars</em> of American
property for residence and the use of their educational, medical,
publishing and religious enterprises.</p>

<p class='c011'>These figures do not cover the large commercial interests of Americans
in Turkey, for which statistics are not at hand.</p>

<h3 class='c032'>2. <span class='sc'>Nature and Extent of the Danger to which they are Exposed.</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>There are two sources of danger: first, the <em>lawlessness</em> of numerous
highwaymen who infest the country, and of the fanatical Moslem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>population of the cities; and second, the <em>hostility</em> of Turkish
officials, who have repeatedly failed to restrain, and in some cases
have even encouraged attacks upon the lives and property of American
citizens.</p>

<h3 class='c032'>3. <span class='sc'>Evidence of this Dangerous Condition.</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>So far back as June 29th, 1881, Secretary Blaine, in official instructions
to Minister Wallace at Constantinople, wrote:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your attention will doubtless be prominently and painfully
drawn to the insecurity of the lives and property of foreign travelers
in Turkey, and the failures of the authorities to prevent or repress
outrages upon American citizens by wayside robbers and murderers,
or even to execute its own laws in the rare instances of the perpetrators
of such outrages being brought to justice. I cannot take a better
text on which to base this instruction, than the accompanying copy
of a letter addressed to the President by a number of American residents
in Turkey. Its statements are known to be entirely within the
truth, and can be verified abundantly from the files of your legation.
They show in simple yet forcible language, the insecurity of traveling
in that country, and <em>the instances to the number of eight, within the
past two years, when American citizens have been robbed and
beaten by lawless marauders</em>. On these occasions the lives of the
assailed have been at the mercy of the robbers and, in one instance
at least, the taking of life preceded the robbery.”—<cite>Foreign Relations
of the United States 1881.</cite></p>

<p class='c011'>The above extract refers to outrages in Western Asia Minor and
the vicinity of Constantinople, but it is well known that in the
Eastern and interior part of Turkey, where many of us live, <em>the insecurity
is greater and has steadily increased, during the thirteen
years that have elapsed since the above facts were admitted by the State
Department</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The murderous attack by a Kurdish chief in person, which nearly
cost Dr. G. C. Reynolds, of Van his life, and for which <em>no indemnity
was ever obtained</em>, though the assailant was positively identified in
court, is reported in full in <cite>Foreign Relations of the United States</cite>,
1883, 1884, and 1890.</p>

<p class='c011'>The arrest and indignities inflicted upon Mr. Richardson of Erzerum,
by the Governor-General, for which <em>no apology even was ever
secured</em>, are related in <cite>Foreign Relations of the United States</cite> 1891.</p>

<p class='c011'>The burning of Marsovan College by an unrestrained Turkish mob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and the <cite>danger to the lives of many American residents</cite> is found in
<cite>Foreign Relations of the United States</cite> 1893.</p>

<p class='c011'>More cases of injury and insult, may be found in the same official
records. But in many other instances it has been felt to be useless
and inexpedient to even report them. <em>The absence of any American
representative to substantiate and vindicate our rights on the ground,
and the hopelessness of securing anything but further injury by trying
to press our claims, often drives us to the humiliating necessity of
suffering injustice with scarcely a protest.</em></p>

<h3 class='c018'>THE REQUEST.</h3>

<p class='c020'>We feel that the condition shown by the above evidence, not to
add more, abundantly justifies a renewed request for <em>some Consular
protection in the Eastern part of Turkey, for the American citizens
permanently residing there in the prosecution of lawful pursuits</em>.
Our present exposed and helpless condition is clearly set forth in a
communication from the United States Legation at Constantinople,
to the State Department: “It may not be doubted that the absence
of an American Consul at Erzroom leaves our citizens there singularly
destitute of means to vindicate their rights and protect their interests;
this is the more regrettable as Erzroom is a missionary station of considerable
importance, and situated in a province where official protection
is most frequently and urgently needed. <em>The British Consul
there is instructed to act ‘unofficially’ for our citizens, but his right
to represent them is not recognized by the Ottoman authorities; the
obvious consequence is, that when his good offices are most needed, they
are of least avail.</em>” <cite>Foreign Relations of the United States</cite> 1891.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are thus seen to be cut off from Consular protection of any
kind. The nearest U. S. Consul, Mr. Jewett of Sivas, an excellent
man, is unavailable for us for three reasons: first, the delay and
difficulty in communicating with him on account of our isolation, and
the very circuitous post-routes, in case the local authorities were kind
enough not to intercept our letters, as they have repeatedly, even the
official correspondence of the United States Minister (<cite>Foreign Relations
of the U. S.</cite> 1893); second, the distance and methods of
travel are such that probably from one to two months would elapse
after any outrage, before the Sivas Consul could be notified and
arrive; third, the Consul at Sivas could not leave his post without
neglecting the large American interests in Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Aside from being needed when special difficulties do occur, it is
obvious that the mere presence of a United States Consul on the
ground would have a marked effect in <em>deterring</em> both the lawless and
fanatical elements, and the officials, who have never seen the stars and
stripes, from repeating acts which have caused much injury to the
interests of American citizens, and have been <em>the occasion of tedious
and unpleasant diplomatic correspondence between the two countries</em>.
The expense of living in Turkey is unusually low.</p>

<p class='c011'>In view of all the foregoing facts, it is urgently requested that
American Consuls be located at Erzerum and Harpoot. These cities
are large centres of population and of American interests, and the
seats of Provincial Governors. They have large commercial and
strategic importance, and as good facilities for communication by
post, telegraph, or private messenger as the country affords. From
Erzerum, Bitlis and Van could also be cared for, while Mardin and
Mosul would naturally be under Harpoot, and thus the Americans of
that whole territory would be brought within two or three week’s
journey of Consular protection.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are from seven hundred to one thousand miles from Constantinople,
which means a journey of three to six weeks. The fact that
at least <em>5,000 men, women and children in our midst have been massacred,
and this fact kept nearly three months from the civilized world,
is a significant hint as to our isolation and danger</em>. The articles in
the last <cite>Harper’s Weekly</cite>, Dec. 29, and in the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>,
Jan. 1895, give much light on the situation.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A cutting from the <cite>Herald</cite> has been sent to me to-day containing a
letter of His Excellency, Mavroyeni, on the Armenian atrocities. I
must strongly object to the use he makes of a letter of mine in the
Boston <cite>Congregationalist</cite> of last year (December 23, 1893).</p>

<p class='c011'>The object of that letter was to show the absurdity of the revolutionary
plotters. The Armenians are a noble race, but few in number,
scattered and unarmed. The Turkish Government has never
had the least fear of any such movement. It knows well that there is
no place in the Empire where one thousand or even one hundred Armenians
could assemble with hostile intent. And besides they have
no arms, and they are not accustomed to their use. They would be
lambs in the midst of wolves. Every one knows this who knows anything
of Turkey outside of Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be greatly regretted that the Ottoman Ambassador should
attempt to cover up the path of these horrid atrocities which have
agitated the whole Christian world and for which Turkey must give
account. It were far better to deplore the fact and work for justice
and judgment. It may be the time has passed when such deeds of
blood and torture, committed upon unarmed men, women and children,
can be condoned by the civilized world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plots of the revolutionists were harmless as to any effective
force, but were very pernicious in arousing fanaticism. The fact
that a few hair-brained young men in foreign lands had plotted a revolution
was a sufficient reason in the view of Moslem fanaticism for
devoting the whole race to destruction. It was this which I feared
and it is this which has happened.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Another object of the letter, from which His Excellency has quoted,
was to draw attention to the fact that this revolutionary movement is
a game which Russia is playing in her own interests. And she has
played it well. She has again caught Turkey in her trap. The
whole civilized world will now approve of her marching in with force
to stop the slaughter of an industrious, peaceful, unarmed peasantry.
If Russia enters, it will be with professions of great kindness toward
the Sultan. It will be to aid him in his well known benevolent intentions
in the government of his Christian subjects! But she will
call the Armenians to her standard and will arm and train them and
they will prove a brave and valiant soldiery. Some of the ablest
generals of the Russian army have been Armenians. Thus armed
and trained, with the aid of their Russian allies, they will defend
their own homes in the Sassoun or any other district.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turkey has brought this upon herself. His Excellency is a Greek
gentleman, and has a natural sympathy with Russia. His influence
has been to magnify the revolutionary plots instead of showing, as
my letter did, their insignificance and their Russian character, and
has led his government to give to them an importance which seems
absurd. The Turkish Government has had sufficient opportunity to
study and understand Russia since the Treaty of 1829, and again of
1833. Have her trusted advisers been true to her, or have they
betrayed her interests?</p>

<p class='c011'>The civilized and Christian world awaits with profound and fixed
attention the solution of the question whether bloody, fanatical violence
or law shall reign over the Eastern regions of the Turkish
Empire.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>APPENDIX D.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c033'>With what intelligence and religious toleration the censorship of
the press is conducted may be judged from examples found in an
official document:</p>

<p class='c026'>“The quotation, in religious books, of the words of Scripture for
proof or illustration, has been subjected to the will of the censor; and
even the printing of religious books has been objected to on the
ground that since Christians are graciously allowed to use the Holy
Bible, they need no other books of religion. Appeal from the decisions
of the censors is practically unavailing. This censor insists
that the Scriptural phrase ‘Kingdom of Christ’ may not be used by
Christians....</p>

<p class='c026'>“The index list of the Bible lessons for 1893 is simply a table of
contents prepared by the British Sunday School Union. The censors
have refused to permit the publication of this index list, unless
some fifty titles are erased, or modified into a form at variance with
the matter of the lessons, or expanded to a degree impossible in a brief
table of contents, for example: St. Luke iv., 14–21, ‘Gospel liberty.’
The word ‘liberty’ must be erased. Jeremiah xxxiii., 7–16, ‘Sorrow
turned to joy.’ This title must be suppressed. Haggai ii., 1–9,
‘Encouraging the people.’ This title, which refers to the Divine

<p class='c011'>We learn that four months after the complaint was made the particular
points specified above were arranged. But as soon as foreign
pressure was relaxed the activity of the Censor revived, and is now
more intolerable than ever. A gentleman of long experience and
intimate knowledge writing from behind the scenes within a month,
states: “The Censorship of the Press is so severe as to amount
almost to a prohibition. At Constantinople a most reckless and
destructive mutilation of books goes on; and, contrary to the expressed
utterances of the Porte guaranteeing religious liberty, Christian
doctrines are expunged or changed, so as, at times, to become
ridiculous and false. The men appointed as Censors of the Press
seem to be utterly ignorant of all Christian literature and history and
their object is to make all books conform to the doctrines of Islam.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The religious weekly of the American Mission in Syria, which
had been published for thirty years, was suppressed for a whole year,
no reason being given; and when the permit was finally secured, it
was accompanied by puerile and humiliating conditions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Some special departments of literature, such as history and poetry,
are forbidden, wholesale, by the Censor. Many of the Censor’s decisions
and the grounds on which they are based would be most laughable,
but for the fact that they are part of an attempt to throttle and
starve the hungry and growing minds of millions.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. “I am at a loss to know why the Reports of Consuls ceased to be
furnished in or about the year 1881. Consuls are supposed to keep
their eyes open and to report facts regarding the people among whom
they live, and it is altogether a new idea that their Reports are to be
regarded as confidential documents. If they are to be so, that is
simply condemning the Consuls’ Reports to perpetual barrenness and
absolute inutility. Why are not consular reports to be made, and
being made, why are they not to be printed? If in this respect I am
personally, or anyone associated with me, is open to censure, let the
facts be brought out; but do not let a particular act at a particular
time be confounded with the adoption of the principle of eternal
silence about the horrors that prevail in Armenia.”—Speech by the
Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone, in House of Commons, May 28, 1889.</p>

a Turkish Commission, and, to judge by past experience, Turkish
Commissions are instruments by which truth is suppressed and issues
are obscured. It is satisfactory that representatives of Great Britain,
France, and Russia will have the opportunity of examining the <em>procès-verbaux</em>,
besides being present at the sittings of the Commission; and
credit is due to the British Foreign Office for having taken the initiative
in securing this concession; but it must be remembered that the
powers of the international representatives will be strictly limited, and
that they will not be able to guarantee the security of the witnesses.”—F.

inhuman. I do not refer to fables which may be invented at St.

<p class='c011'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. By far the largest part of foreign missionary work in Turkey
has always been in the hands of Americans, although, of course,
they neither claim nor have any monopoly in this respect. As a matter
of fact there are many other large and successful missionary, benevolent,
and educational enterprises conducted in that land by other
foreign societies as well as individuals. The various Roman Catholic
orders are strongly established in many parts, and are generally of
French connections and introduce that language in their work as the
Americans do English. The following is a partial list of other societies
at work in Turkey: The British and Foreign Bible Society, the
Church Missionary Society, the Bible Lands Missions Aid Society,
the British Syrian Mission Schools and Bible Work, the Church of
Scotland Mission to the Jews, the Society of Friends (both English
and American), the Irish Presbyterian Mission, the Reformed Presbyterian
Mission, and the German Deaconesses. In addition to all
these agencies, there are many private and local schools and institutions
that are doing excellent work, but of which only this general
mention can here be made.</p>

<p class='c011'>The statistics of Robert College, Constantinople, are not included
in these tables, as that institution, though a child of American Missions,
is independent of them.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f71'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. “The creation of churches, strict in their discipline, and protesting
against the mass of superstitions which smother all spiritual life
in the National Armenian Church, is undoubtedly having a very salutary
effect far beyond the limited membership, and is tending to force
reform upon an ancient church which contains within herself the elements
of resurrection.”—Mrs. Bishop, <cite>Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan</cite>,
vol. ii., p. 336.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. Unhappily there are some who can see nothing but bigotry and
mistakes in what the missionaries have done. Such characters are to
be found among all races, as the following extract shows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It might be thought that here, [Missilonghi] on the spot where he
[Byron] breathed his last, malignity would have held her accursed
tongue; but it was not so. He had committed the fault, unpardonable
in the eyes of political opponents, of attaching himself to one of the
great parties that then divided Greece; and though he had given her all
that man could give, in his own dying words, ‘his time, his means,
his health, and, lastly, his life,’ the Greeks spoke of him with all the
rancour and bitterness of party spirit. Even death had not won oblivion
for his political offences; and I heard those who saw him die in
her cause affirm that Byron was no friend to Greece.”—Stephens,
<cite>Greece, Turkey, Russia, and Poland</cite>, New York: Harper and Brothers,
1839.</p>
